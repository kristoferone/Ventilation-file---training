<h2 data-label="312518" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 26, 2019</h2><div>Despite being pretty sore from the move, I had a really good session on the erg last night. I really think my core endurance program is giving me the capacity to get through these workouts well. I'm looking forward to being even stronger over the next few months. </div><div>I had a very strong core workout this morning. I'm going to add in the medicine ball for a little extra resistance. So today I did:</div><ul><li>Endurance 35:25</li><li>Stability 11:40</li><li>Lower core 5:50</li><li>Nelo challenge 1:00 </li></ul><div>Total: <b>53:55</b></div><div>That's a pretty solid workout. I'm going to add one more exercise (mountain climbers) to the lower core set. </div><div></div><div></div>
