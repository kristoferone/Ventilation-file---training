<h2 data-label="312518" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 26, 2019</h2><div>Despite being pretty sore from the move, I had a really good session on the erg last night. I really think my core endurance program is giving me the capacity to get through these workouts well. I'm looking forward to being even stronger over the next few months. </div><div>I had a very strong core workout this morning. I'm going to add in the medicine ball for a little extra resistance. </div><div>So today I did:</div><ul><li>Endurance 35:25</li><li>Stability 11:40</li><li>Lower core 5:50</li><li>Nelo challenge 1:00 </li></ul><div>Total: <b>53:55</b></div><div>That's a pretty solid workout. I'm going to add one more exercise (mountain climbers) to the lower core set. That will bring it to 6:50. </div><div>C1 is so technical. It's an incredible coordination of different parts. You can focus on one thing and everything else falls apart, then focus on something else. I'm going to try and do lots of visualization work this week to try and help focus myself for next week. I'm also going to add an extra exercise to my strength training.</div><div>On the subject of strength training, tomorrow I'll do strength and bike. For strength I want to do push-ups, pull-ups, roll-outs, dead-lifts, and one-arm rows. </div><div>I'm again not convinced I'm getting everything I need out of the workout apps I'm using. I wonder if I should try some different approaches. Circuit training for example. That might be a good idea. </div><div>The slightly tricky thing is that I do pull-ups on a different floor than the rest. It's still manageable though. </div><div>I think I should do timed intervals of circuits. In other words, a certain number of repetitions for each exercise in a circuit and repeat circuits for the set length of time. Then a rest interval. Tomorrow I'll do intervals of four m</div><div></div><div></div>
