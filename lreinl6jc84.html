<h2 data-label="312518" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 26, 2019</h2><div>Despite being pretty sore from the move, I had a really good session on the erg last night. I really think my core endurance program is giving me the capacity to get through these workouts well. I'm looking forward to being even stronger over the next few months. </div><div>I had a very strong core workout this morning. I'm going to add in the medicine ball for a little extra resistance. </div><div>So today I did:</div><ul><li>Endurance 35:25</li><li>Stability 11:40</li><li>Lower core 5:50</li><li>Nelo challenge 1:00 </li></ul><div>Total: <b>53:55</b></div><div>That's a pretty solid workout. I'm going to add one more exercise (mountain climbers) to the lower core set. That will bring it to 6:50. </div><div>C1 is so technical. It's an incredible coordination of different parts. You can focus on one thing and everything else falls apart, then focus on something else. I'm going to try and do lots of visualization work this week to try and help focus myself for next week. I'm also going to add an extra exercise to my strength training.</div><div>On the subject of strength training, tomorrow I'll do strength and bike. For strength I want to do push-ups, pull-ups, roll-outs, dead-lifts, and one-arm rows. </div><div>I'm again not convinced I'm getting everything I need out of the workout apps I'm using. I wonder if I should try some different approaches. Circuit training for example. That might be a good idea. </div><div>The slightly tricky thing is that I do pull-ups on a different floor than the rest. It's still manageable though. </div><div>I think I should do timed intervals of circuits. In other words, a certain number of repetitions for each exercise in a circuit and repeat circuits for the set length of time. Then a rest interval. Tomorrow I'll do intervals of four minutes with two minutes rest between. I'll aim for a total of of four intervals and 24 minutes. Within each interval I'll do sets of 10 push-ups, 6 roll-outs, 6 dead-lifts, 10 one-arm rows each side, then I'll repeat the whole thing as many times as I can over four minutes. That's a bit of a different approach than what I've been doing. For pull-ups I'll just have to do what I was doing before or something like it. Sets of 3, one minute rest for 10 minutes or something like that. I think I should do half and half pull-ups and chin-ups or hands in hands out. </div><div>That's not a huge amount of strength work. And that will only be two sessions this week so not very much at all. That because I'm really prioritizing core over strength. I think for this season that will be good. We'll see about next. </div><div>So what will my focus be for each exercise tomorrow morning? </div><div>For all exercises, engage TA, squeeze shoulder blades, smooth and even, keep chest open</div><ul><li>Roll-outs - keep arms strong, initiate movement from hips, engage TA</li><li>Single-arm row - stand on one leg, rotate body around hip</li><li>Push-ups - very rhythmic, no cheating!</li><li>Deadlifts - Romanian, smooth, focus on hips</li></ul><div>So, meditation, strength, bike, pull-ups. That's a busy morning! I'd better get to bed early and get up early! </div><div>I'm going to use my best visualization skills to try and improve my paddle stroke in between Monday workouts. </div><h2 data-label="219281" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 27, 2019</h2><div>A very solid workout this morning! I did strength then bike. For strength I did 5 sets of 4 minutes with 1 minute rest. It was very hard. I was definitely, sweating, breathing hard, and struggling for good form by the last one. I have no idea how much I did of each individual exercise. I don't think that really matters though. I rotated he exercises so I started each set with a different one. I wonder if I should add another exercise to make it an even five? Not sure. The one thing that didn't go quite so well was pull-ups. It was getting a bit late and Mara's back was bad again so I didn't do very many. I wonder if I should try and do pull-ups every day but in the evening. Pull-ups and stretching. That's still a good idea. I keep having it and it's always and still a good idea. The best addition to my strength routine was the one-arm rows. They are really a lot like what paddling feels like. They're hard too!</div><div>So this is great. I'm feeling really good about my training right this moment. My ongoing test for how my strength and conditioning is going is how well I'm getting through my Monday erg workouts. The stronger and fitter I get, the better I should do in those workouts. </div><div>Technique is so important. I have to keep analyzing and identifying various aspects of good paddling technique and keep reinforcing those with training and mental work.&nbsp;</div><div>How will I progress my strength work? And how will I develop and incorporate pull-ups? How can I make the most of mental work? </div><div>When I was at my most successful at both cycling and at guitar, I was doing a lot of meditation and a lot of visualization work. One of the best things I was able to do was to concentrate my focus on certain parts of my body and move that focus around. I can still do that but I suspect not as well as I could then. That's certainly something I can work on developing again. It's great that I developed it with my guitar playing. That means I can reconnect with it through my guitar playing without too much trouble. </div><div>The meditation work I do is very useful for developing the beginnings of that capacity. I just need to keep it going into my strength and core work. Then it will give me something to focus on during hard erg workouts. </div><div>I was really happy about how my strength training went this morning. I felt like I was really getting some good work done. Now the question is how to scale it up gradually. So what are the variables that can scale? The total number of circuits. Today I did 5. I could gradually add more. I think I'll keep the weight more or less where it is. I can also add more repetitions to each exercise. That's probably the most productive variable to increase. I was doing sets of 10 for everything today. </div><div>What would be a good progression? 10 12 14 12 14 16 ... something like that?</div><div>Alright, for tomorrow: back to core. </div><ul><li>Endurance</li><li>Stability</li><li>Lower core</li><li>Nelo</li><li>and meditation as always</li></ul><div>My focus is going to </div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
