<div>I don't want Kal to draw me into his usual insecurities and sleaziness. He's a very sweet guy and I like him a lot but he&nbsp;<i>is</i> insecure and I'm&nbsp;<i>always</i> ashamed of my behaviour when I'm around him. Perhaps, Peter will be there. I like Peter. I like Kal too. I just don't like the way he pulls both of us down. Don't leer at the girls on the dance floor. Find people to talk to. Talk to Megan. Talk to Sarah. Talk to Cindy. Talk to Nat even. Definitely talk to what's her name? Laurence. I don't really want to talk with Tera and her dopey husband. But I will! Be charming and sociable. Don't get drunk. Four drink maximum. A beer before. Two glasses of wine with dinner. One more after. Lots of water. You have to be up and a good parent the next morning. You also have a workout to do in the morning. </div><div> Our night will probably not end the way Mara intimated a couple of weeks ago. The boys sleeping over is really the only way that's going to work. I wish Mara would go out with some friends soon. I'm going to get a little bit of beer for after my workout tonight. Just two little bottles or cans. So one or two beers before and with dinner and one after. Remember to breathe. </div><div>I'm starting a new training plan on the bike. I'm super excited about the idea of gravel biking and the possibility of doing some races, not this year but in 2021. Ski races in 2022. Canoe races this year. Canoe is my main focus and I think that will stay the case for a while. The planning of when I want to start racing has to do with the amount of time I think I'll need in order to be able to get through the races. I have a strong background in cycling, but it's not enough to get me through </div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
