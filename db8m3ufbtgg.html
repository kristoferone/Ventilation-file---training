<div>I don't want Kal to draw me into his usual insecurities and sleaziness. He's a very sweet guy and I like him a lot but he&nbsp;<i>is</i> insecure and I'm&nbsp;<i>always</i> ashamed of my behaviour when I'm around him. Perhaps, Peter will be there. I like Peter. I like Kal too. I just don't like the way he pulls both of us down. Don't leer at the girls on the dance floor. Find people to talk to. Talk to Megan. Talk to Sarah. Talk to Cindy. Talk to Nat even. Definitely talk to what's her name? Laurence. I don't really want to talk with Tera and her dopey husband. But I will! Be charming and sociable. Don't get drunk. Four drink maximum. A beer before. Two glasses of wine with dinner. One more after. Lots of water. You have to be up and a good parent the next morning. You also have a workout to do in the morning. </div><div> Our night will probably not end the way Mara intimated a couple of weeks ago. The boys sleeping over is really the only way that's going to work. I wish Mara would go out with some friends soon. I'm going to get a little bit of beer for after my workout tonight. Just two little bottles or cans. So one or two beers before and with dinner and one after. Remember to breathe. </div><div>I'm starting a new training plan on the bike. I'm super excited about the idea of gravel biking and the possibility of doing some races, not this year but in 2021. Ski races in 2022. Canoe races this year. Canoe is my main focus and I think that will stay the case for a while. The planning of when I want to start racing has to do with the amount of time I think I'll need in order to be able to get through the races. I have a strong background in cycling, but it's not enough to get me through a race this year. I also don't have the equipment. And I don't really have time to do a lot of training. That's why another year will be necessary to build up the fitness I'll need to complete some races. With skiing, I have very little skill, technique, or specific fitness so that will take an additional year to get ready. This year get some miles on your skis. Next year do some skate skiing. The year after plan on doing a race. </div><div>There are also gear considerations for all of these...</div><h2 data-label="996682" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 10, 2020</h2><div>Another frustrating and unproductive morning. Better than yesterday though. I was able to update and calibrate my trainer which is pretty great and definitely well worth the frustration and aggravation. My power is now displaying correctly though the cadence was off. That's fine though; who cares about cadence really? I have two rides to do this week and two days in which to do them so that's just fine. I'll probably do the heavier workout tomorrow and the lighter on Sunday to help prepare for next week. </div><div>Scratch all that. I just revised my training plan to begin next week and to continue for 8 weeks until the beginning of March. So roughly I'm breaking this next phase of my training into to large chunks: one, more-or-less, until Montebello when I'd like to be a bit leaner and definitely want to have some good fitness to show off. And then the next phase until the start of canoeing season. The important thing for this phase is to build up some good endurance form and core strength and to keep developing my canoeing technique. </div><div>I'm going to increase my time on the bike with a couple of goals: to increase my aerobic capacity and general level of fitness, to lose weight, to start laying the base for the possibility of doing some gravel racing in 2021. My goal for this summer is very simple: to spend as much time as I can in the canoe and to do some races. I also want to get out on my bike quite a lot. 4-6 times a week in the canoe, 2 times a week on the bike -&nbsp; out and about, not on the trainer. I'll need a bike tune-up before the Spring.&nbsp;</div><div>So maybe I'll rest up for the rest of this weekend. Meditate and stretch sure, but get a bit more sleep and no hard workouts. On Monday begin a new phase of training. Monday is a new start. Begin from there. Nothing that's happened already matters. Try to begin the week feeling fresh and rested. (not too hung-over)</div><div>My specific goals for this period are to reach my target weight of 83 kg and an overall improvement in my cycling fitness. I hope the benchmarking section is up and running soon. I don't really feel like I've made any progress with SPOK'D, which is a bit disappointing as I really like it. They keep adding new features and it's fairly inexpensive so I'll stick with it a bit longer. I'd really like to see some development over the next 8 weeks. </div><div>In great news! I went skiing at Mooney's Bay last night. It was awesome. I'm an absolute shit skier. I'm going to go a bunch of times and </div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
