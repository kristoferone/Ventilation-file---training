<div>I don't want Kal to draw me into his usual insecurities and sleaziness. He's a very sweet guy and I like him a lot but he&nbsp;<i>is</i> insecure and I'm&nbsp;<i>always</i> ashamed of my behaviour when I'm around him. Perhaps, Peter will be there. I like Peter. I like Kal too. I just don't like the way he pulls both of us down. Don't leer at the girls on the dance floor. Find people to talk to. Talk to Megan. Talk to Sarah. Talk to Cindy. Talk to Nat even. Definitely talk to what's her name? Laurence. I don't really want to talk with Tera and her dopey husband. But I will! Be charming and sociable. Don't get drunk. Four drink maximum. A beer before. Two glasses of wine with dinner. One more after. Lots of water. You have to be up and a good parent the next morning. You also have a workout to do in the morning. </div><div> Our night will probably not end the way Mara intimated a couple of weeks ago. The boys sleeping over is really the only way that's going to work. I wish Mara would go out with some friends soon. I'm going to get a little bit of beer for after my workout tonight. Just two little bottles or cans. So one or two beers before and with dinner and one after. Remember to breathe. </div><div>I'm starting a new training plan on the bike. I'm super excited about the idea of gravel biking and the possibility of doing some races, not this year but in 2021. Ski races in 2022. Canoe races this year. Canoe is my main focus and I think that will stay the case for a while. The planning of when I want to start racing has to do with the amount of time I think I'll need in order to be able to get through the races. I have a strong background in cycling, but it's not enough to get me through a race this year. I also don't have the equipment. And I don't really have time to do a lot of training. That's why another year will be necessary to build up the fitness I'll need to complete some races. With skiing, I have very little skill, technique, or specific fitness so that will take an additional year to get ready. This year get some miles on your skis. Next year do some skate skiing. The year after plan on doing a race. </div><div>There are also gear considerations for all of these...</div><h2 data-label="996682" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 10, 2020</h2><div>Another frustrating and unproductive morning. Better than yesterday though. I was able to update and calibrate my trainer which is pretty great and definitely well worth the frustration and aggravation. My power is now displaying correctly though the cadence was off. That's fine though; who cares about cadence really? I have two rides to do this week and two days in which to do them so that's just fine. I'll probably do the heavier workout tomorrow and the lighter on Sunday to help prepare for next week. </div><div>Scratch all that. I just revised my training plan to begin next week and to continue for 8 weeks until the beginning of March. So roughly I'm breaking this next phase of my training into to large chunks: one, more-or-less, until Montebello when I'd like to be a bit leaner and definitely want to have some good fitness to show off. And then the next phase until the start of canoeing season. The important thing for this phase is to build up some good endurance form and core strength and to keep developing my canoeing technique. </div><div>I'm going to increase my time on the bike with a couple of goals: to increase my aerobic capacity and general level of fitness, to lose weight, to start laying the base for the possibility of doing some gravel racing in 2021. My goal for this summer is very simple: to spend as much time as I can in the canoe and to do some races. I also want to get out on my bike quite a lot. 4-6 times a week in the canoe, 2 times a week on the bike -&nbsp; out and about, not on the trainer. I'll need a bike tune-up before the Spring.&nbsp;</div><div>So maybe I'll rest up for the rest of this weekend. Meditate and stretch sure, but get a bit more sleep and no hard workouts. On Monday begin a new phase of training. Monday is a new start. Begin from there. Nothing that's happened already matters. Try to begin the week feeling fresh and rested. (not too hung-over)</div><div>My specific goals for this period are to reach my target weight of 83 kg and an overall improvement in my cycling fitness. I hope the benchmarking section is up and running soon. I don't really feel like I've made any progress with SPOK'D, which is a bit disappointing as I really like it. They keep adding new features and it's fairly inexpensive so I'll stick with it a bit longer. I'd really like to see some development over the next 8 weeks. </div><div>In great news! I went skiing at Mooney's Bay last night. It was awesome. I'm an absolute shit skier. I'm going to go a bunch of times and try to really improve this winter. Like the rest of this block of training, I have about 8 weeks of skiing ahead. I'm going to buy a season's pass and try to get the most value out of it and that means skiing at least 10 times. I'll try and get out twice a week if I can and that will be a huge development in my time skiing over any other years. It's great cross-training. I was surprised at how low my effort was last night. It was zone 1 the entire workout. It's because I basically have no technique. I can't push myself. Here's hoping that, with some development in my technical abilities, I'll be able to do more substantial workouts. </div><div>Oh, on a side note before I forget, the trick to updating my trainer firmware is to only have it attached to one thing at a time. So I have the Tacx utility on my phone and Zwift on my tablet. Only one can be connected at a time. So there you go.</div><div>Alright! What next. Close the book on this period of your training. You've done great work! You've lost weight, improved your body composition, learned new exercises, improved your technique, improved your strength, improved your endurance, improved your flexibility, improved your mental skills, and started a new sport. In other words you've become a better athlete all around. Tonight you can just relax and not worry about having to get up early. Do some stretching and meditation if you want but don't stress about it. Do whatever you want this weekend. No pressure. No obligation. Just breathe. Just relax. Be a good dad. Be a safe driver. Be kind to yourself. Don't be a creep at the office party. Let the boys binge on devices but not too much. Play games. Make them laugh. Be creative. Relax. Love yourself. Love your family. Don't shout at anyone including Freddie. You're doing great at your training. Be nice to Mara. Be patient. Be kind. </div><div>Monday will be the start of eight weeks ending on March 6th. That's two blocks of building for three weeks then a recovery week, then build for another three and recover. </div><div>The big focus for this period is technique. The results will come. The results are implicit in the process. All you have to do is create the right conditions for success and success will happen. The basic conditions for success are simple and they're the same for just about every activity. Shearer nailed it when he talked about the necessary conditions for performance: confidence and security. Confidence is the outlook that, based on past experience, you'll be able to accomplish the task. Security encompasses accuracy and continuity. In effect security is your ability to carry out tasks through aim-directed movement. I keep talking about this but it's absolutely crucial. And it begins with mental work, being able to visualize movements with correct technique accurately. Then as you accomplish the task, you give direction through the visualization and your body carries it out accurately. </div><div>This is the approach: you're not going to worry about the results. You don't have to make the results happen. You're only going to focus on the necessary conditions for success and the results will come. </div><div>I will need to move slightly away from the Headspace app. It's very good and I think there's probably lots of ways I can still use it, but I need a bit more headspace (ha!) to think through technical processes. I think some of the pro packs act just as timers. </div><h2 data-label="127288" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 13, 2019</h2><div>Monday! And the beginning of a new block of training. This block will go for eight weeks until March 6. What I'd like to achieve in this time is an overall improvement in my base fitness which will come primarily through time on the bike. What I'd like to see is an improvement in my FTP score. That sits currently at 208 watts and hasn't moved significantly in quite a while. I'll want to test my FTP at about the mid-point and then again at the end. My FTP divided by my weight in kg is my overall indicator of fitness. Monday February 10th is about the midway point and a good time to test. I'd like to continue to lose weight and reach my target weight of 83 kg and my body fat less than 18%. Core training continues to be a high priority particularly incorporating balance and stability. </div><div>The biggest priority for this block of training is the mental aspect. Mental work, visualization, and focus are the basis of good technique in all my endeavours. </div><div>I'm going to have a particular technical focus that I will use for visualization and for refining my technique. For canoe, it's the perfect A shape the reach. My goal is to hit that shape every single stroke. For cycling it will be my upper body. Relaxed shoulders, in line, moving forward. I'm only on the bike three hours this week so I can certainly keep a focus on my upper body for that time. For skiing, it's going to be on  weight transfer from one ski to the other. Do at least half of your ski without poles to work on that. For push-ups, it's the full extension of my arms. I have to hit that full extension every time. For pull-ups, it's the feeling of my shoulder blades squeezing together at the beginning of the movement. For core, it's just resting my focus on my pelvis jus&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
