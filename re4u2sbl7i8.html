<div>Before all that though, I still have two bike workouts left to do this week. They shouldn't be very hard and I definitely shouldn't push them very much. There's still lots of time to go hard over the next few months.&nbsp;</div><div>My two rather large sporting expenses this month will be skate skis and signing up for my RCC session for the summer. All together probably over $700. Yikes! Let's hope for a good tax return! I'll also make a donation to the club. That means that I'll have to put bike repairs off until next month. I'll try and get into the shed and see what state the KH1 is in. That makes so much sense to turn that into a proper gravel bike. It was meant to be!</div><div>I'm going to work hard on my visualization skills over the next period as well. I want to be able to leverage that skill to improve my racing abilities. </div><div>OK, what's up for tomorrow? Bike in the morning. No big deal. Try and keep your efforts reasonable. I have five zone 5 intervals to do and I can try and push that benchmark.</div><h2 data-label="184509" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 06, 2020</h2><div>Just a few short days ago I toyed with the idea of breaking 1000 w as my top end power. I did that this morning and upped my 10-second power to 919 w. That means that a 10-second power of over 1000 w is not only possible but very much within reach. I have to race this year. I'm getting too strong not to. I'll definitely target those last two gravel races in the Fall. I want to get Jamie into cyclocross. He'll need a much better bike though. For the next block of training I definitely want to push my 20-minute power to 300. I think I could actually do that right now. I wonder if it would be possible to push it to 400 by the time those races roll around. Bring on the puncheur! Gravel puncheur, I like the sound of that!</div><div>I think that visualization is going to be key for getting the most out of my power. I did a bit this morning. I wasn't terribly focused and my mind kept wandering. Like anything, you have to start things with a clear goal. This is basic Shearer. </div><div>I think my goals are starting to swim into focus. I'm going to do a sprint program for the next six weeks then I'll transition into a long-term plan to target the Fall races. I should probably do a cyclocross or road-racing program. Maybe cyclocross? Should I race cyclocross? What if Jamie and I do that together? </div><div>I'm going to scrap my last bike of this program tomorrow morning and go skiing instead! It looks like it's going to be lovely. Soooooo I can create my new plan now :)</div><div>There! Set up my new plan. I chose a cycolcross training program. Going until May 3rd. Which will hopefully lead into paddling season at which point I'll alter my training a bit to make time for paddling. So I'm all set to start my new plan. My goal is to get down to, but not lower than 80 kg. I'm hoping to build a bit of muscle and keep moving my percentage of body fat down. I think getting below 16%. I've dropped my body fat by a similar amount over the last training block so I think it's possible again. </div><div>I'm actually not a big believer in training zones. I think it's better to tackle specific power levels to improve the benchmarks that are relevant to the type of racing you want to do. In my case, the two important benchmarks I want to improve for this period are my 3-minute power and my 20-minute power. Those are currently at 366 w and 291 w. I'd like to get them to 400 w and 300 w during this block of training. Pretty reasonable, don't you think? Should I not do intervals at those powers to improve my capacity to ride at that power? I'll start the program more-or-less as recommended and see if my benchmarks move the way I want them to. </div><div>Now the question is whether I continue with Dynamic Cyclist. I find it a bit constricting. It has definitely got me to stretch and that's great, but I wonder if I need the program. I think I should work at stretching in the evenings. That's it, I'm cancelling it.</div><div>I can figure out stretches without it. It's not really good enough quality at the moment for the investment. I'll just learn some of the stretches and make a list of a couple of routines. Also, the amount of talking in the videos stretches the a</div><div></div>
