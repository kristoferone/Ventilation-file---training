There's still lots of time to go hard over the next few months.&nbsp;</div><div>My two rather large sporting expenses this month will be skate skis and signing up for my RCC session for the summer. All together probably over $700. Yikes! Let's hope for a good tax return! I'll also make a donation to the club. That means that I'll have to put bike repairs off until next month. I'll try and get into the shed and see what state the KH1 is in. That makes so much sense to turn that into a proper gravel bike.

I want to be able to leverage that skill to improve my racing abilities. </div><div>OK, what's up for tomorrow? Bike in the morning. No big deal. Try and keep your efforts reasonable.
