<div>As I'm becoming a more fluent paddler, I'm starting to work harder in the canoe. Still no where close to where I am on the bike. Canoe is much more technical and difficult than biking. I can still improve a lot in my cycling as well. I have a double workout tomorrow morning: bike at 5:00, canoe at 6:00. With an additional half hour of bike commuting to and from the club. That's a busy, active morning. I did it last week and it's definitely possible if I get to bed at a reasonable hour. </div><div>To improve my cycling, and let's be honest, I just want to look fast ;) To make some real improvements, I think I have to work on my position on the bike. I should begin to do my intervals in a racing position. I stopped going in the drops over the last little while because my gut was getting in the way. How mortifying! That's disgraceful. Oh well, trying, trying, trying. </div><div>What's a good racing position? Hands in the drops, arms bent, body </div><div>Tonight I'm going to do a strength and core workout. </div>
