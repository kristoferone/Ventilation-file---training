<div>As I'm becoming a more fluent paddler, I'm starting to work harder in the canoe. Still no where close to where I am on the bike. Canoe is much more technical and difficult than biking. I can still improve a lot in my cycling as well. I have a double workout tomorrow morning: bike at 5:00, canoe at 6:00. With an additional half hour of bike commuting to and from the club. That's a busy, active morning. I did it last week and it's definitely possible if I get to bed at a reasonable hour. </div><div>To improve my cycling, and let's be honest, I just want to look fast ;) To make some real improvements, I think I have to work on my position on the bike. I should begin to do my intervals in a racing position. I stopped going in the drops over the last little while because my gut was getting in the way. How mortifying! That's disgraceful. Oh well, trying, trying, trying. </div><div>What's a good racing position? Hands in the drops, arms bent, body low, power from the lower back, focus on the push part of the pedal stroke, cadence at least 90 rpm or higher, neck relaxed. Tomorrow morning I have a perfect workout to practice my position: 3 x 1 minute, zone 4. Zone 4 is over 220 watts so there's a bit of pressure on the pedal. Sit up during recovery. </div><div>I'm going to try and structure my canoe sessions a little more. I want to do about 2 kms a session. So if I go out 200 metres and back five times, that will be 2 kms. It's been fine to just noodle about for now, but I need to create some mental obstacles to overcome. This morning I was ready to stop after about 20 minutes. Mostly because there wasn't any real point to what I was doing apart from paddle, try not to tip. Of course the turning is always the hard part. Maybe I should try and find the 500 metre mark. That would mean a little more on the straight and fewer turns. I think that would be effective. </div><div>Tonight I'm going to do a strength and core workout. Push ups and chin ups for sure.&nbsp;</div><div>As my canoeing ends for the season, I'm going to bring the bike back up and strength training as well. I'll definitely want to do a few good strength sessions a week. Then I'll start strength training at the club and push my maximum lifts a bit. Then when winter comes, I'll start adding in some skiing. Skiing twice a week at Mooney's. Two ski, two club strength, two home strength, three bike. I'd be in pretty decent shape for when paddling season comes back in the spring. There might even be some chance to do sessions on the ergo. That would be awful. Useful though.&nbsp;</div><div>If I can do a combined weight and ergo session program, I will. That might cost about $600 dollars so start saving a bit.&nbsp;</div><div>From now:</div><div><b>August - October</b> paddle, bike, light strength and core</div><div><b>October - November</b> increase bike, increase core</div><div><b>November - April </b>strength, core, ergo, bike</div><div><b>January - April&nbsp;</b>same as above, exchange bike for ski</div><div><b>May - October</b> paddle and bike</div><div>I definitely want to get Mara more engaged with  skiing. She enjoys it so much. </div><h2 data-label="243591" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 7, 2019</h2><div>I did my Wednesday double-workout morning. Bike and canoe. Just a half hour for each, but it all adds up. There's also the half hour of riding to and from the club. Even if I don't count it, my body does.&nbsp;</div><div>I was able to get into and maintain a pretty good race position on the bike for the zone 4 intervals. 1 minute is not very long and 220 watts is not very high so it's not too difficult. I'm slightly confused about my pedalling. Should I try to create a certain pedal stroke by focusing on a particular phase of the stroke? Or should I be more flexible and keep exploring all around the stroke? My inclination is to the latter. It's always better to be more flexible and more open-ended about things. </div><div><b>Alright</b>, now for something completely different. I just read an article that suggests speaking about yourself in the third person has some significant benefits for intellectual and emotional health. So let's give it a go!</div><div>Christopher has been working very hard at his training. He's been focusing on canoeing, but still doing quite a bit of cycling. It's hard work but he's enjoying it. He's still a bit frustrated and disappointed that he hasn't really lost any weight. Christopher struggles with his confidence and with his self esteem. He really does suffer a lot of stress. Confusingly, he keeps creating situations where he's going to be stressed. That's a more difficult conversation though. What should Christopher do? He shouldn't try and rush to short-term gains. If canoeing is the most important, then he should focus on canoeing. That would include Christopher canoeing as often as possible. In addition to that, he should try and get some more rest. He's very tired most days. If he's canoeing and resting then the next thing he should do is work on core strength. Maybe he should get out some of his old core workouts from Chris Lindsay from last winter? Yes, that's a good idea. His biggest struggle is his confidence. That's what makes it hard for him to make decisions and hard for him to stick with things. And to be patient with himself. He's really come a long way. He still has some things to work on. Maybe this will help him. The most important thing is to keep going on things. Not to keep restarting and changing course. Not second-guessing. Just keep going. Canoeing has been so good for Christopher. He really needed it so badly. He needed something challenging, but that he could get better at. This is not quite the place for this but I'll ask the question nevertheless; should Christopher keep working on data science? I'll just ask that question again and Christopher can observe whatever feeling seems to come up.</div><div>Should Christopher keep working on data science?</div><div>He probably should. He should not pursue it to the detriment of other activities though. Christopher will get more benefit from sports, guitar, and reading than from fiddling with techie things. </div><div>This feels really weird, but it's supposedly good for Christopher, so he'll keep trying.</div><div>It's very important for Christopher to be kind and compassionate with himself though not too indulgent. For every extreme, there's its opposite and the swing between polarities is destabilizing and counterproductive. The harder and more judgmental Christopher is on himself, the more indulgent he'll need to be to have stability and stasis. The indulgence leads to more harsh criticism and back and forth in perpetuum. Christopher is really excited about canoeing right now. It's hard to keep excitement and enthusiasm going. He may finally be surfacing out of the depression that he's been dealing with over the last year, though. There might be a lot more excitement and enthusiasm all around. A lot more energy and confidence. </div><div>Christopher is very interested in a kind of mastery of himself. Whether guitar playing, cycling, or canoeing his efforts are very focused on himself. On improvement, on mastery, on self development. It's important for Christopher to remember to include others. To share his successes as well as his failures. To share his activities with others. It's ok that Christopher doesn't enjoy team sports. It's ok that he likes solitary pursuits. That's all fine. But let others in.</div><h2 data-label="380990" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 8, 2019</h2><div>A hard but good paddle this morning. I still haven't figured my verbs out yet. I cycle, I bike, but I don't pedal. I canoe, I paddle. It doesn't really matter but it's interesting for me. I like canoeing. I like cycling. In one I paddle; the other I pedal. Clear enough. </div><div>Starting again, A hard but good canoe this morning. That's two canoe sessions in a row without tipping. I was feeling a bit tired and sore this morning. I think my cycling workout on Saturday is going to be really hard. All of the RPE of my workouts so far have been about 4, this one will be a 7. I mean realistically, my workouts have at times been much higher than 4, but SPOK'D&nbsp;<i>thought</i> they were a 4. This one they think is a 7. More than that, I'm going to be tired by the time I get there. I'm tired today. I should do some good stretching and rollers tonight. </div><div>I'm starting to turn another corner of ability. I can now take a couple of strokes continuously. It's still hard to keep going in a straight line. I should do a bit more up and down the lanes. </div><div>Yesterday, I tried writing in the third person. It was weird. I didn't like it and I don't think I'll do it again. </div><div>There's always the question when one is journalling of how to address oneself. Do you speak to yourself or about yourself or as yourself? I should probably always write as myself. I'll make an effort to do that from now on. It makes it a lot harder to talk in generalities. </div><div>One thing that made a huge difference this morning was consciously pushing back with my left foot. So the power of the stroke is coming from my leg and not from my arms. More accurately it's a whole kinetic chain involving my entire body. It's definitely not just my arms though. Considering that, I should probably do some more kinetic chain strength exercises such as deadlifts (a great exercise all around) and hang cleans. Deadlifts are great for cycling strength as well. </div><div>Earlier in the year (January, February), I was always writing down all the stats from my workouts on Zwift. I've stopped doing that. It's helpful though. Revise that. It helped me though. Whenever I can, I will try and write as myself and I will try and avoid general and vague language or grammatical constructions.&nbsp; </div><div>Back to Zwift.&nbsp;</div><div>Since I started on Zwift on December 24th, 2018, I've:</div><ul><li>Ridden 2,272 kms</li><li>Climbed 24,586 ms</li><li>Burned 54720 calories</li><li>Spent a total of 4 days and 3 hours on the bike</li><li>Reached a level of 18</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
