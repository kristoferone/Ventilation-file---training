<div>&nbsp;As I'm becoming a more fluent paddler, I'm starting to work harder in the canoe. Still no where close to where I am on the bike. Canoe is much more technical and difficult than biking. I can still improve a lot in my cycling as well. I have a double workout tomorrow morning: bike at 5:00, canoe at 6:00. With an additional half hour of bike commuting to and from the club. That's a busy, active morning. I did it last week and it's definitely possible if I get to bed at a reasonable hour. </div><div>To improve my cycling, and let's be honest, I just want to look fast ;) To make some real improvements, I think I have to work on my position on the bike. I should begin to do my intervals in a racing position. I stopped going in the drops over the last little while because my gut was getting in the way. How mortifying! That's disgraceful. Oh well, trying, trying, trying. </div><div>What's a good racing position? Hands in the drops, arms bent, body low, power from the lower back, focus on the push part of the pedal stroke, cadence at least 90 rpm or higher, neck relaxed. Tomorrow morning I have a perfect workout to practice my position: 3 x 1 minute, zone 4. Zone 4 is over 220 watts so there's a bit of pressure on the pedal. Sit up during recovery. </div><div>I'm going to try and structure my canoe sessions a little more. I want to do about 2 kms a session. So if I go out 200 metres and back five times, that will be 2 kms. It's been fine to just noodle about for now, but I need to create some mental obstacles to overcome. This morning I was ready to stop after about 20 minutes. Mostly because there wasn't any real point to what I was doing apart from paddle, try not to tip. Of course the turning is always the hard part. Maybe I should try and find the 500 metre mark. That would mean a little more on the straight and fewer turns. I think that would be effective. </div><div>Tonight I'm going to do a strength and core workout. Push ups and chin ups for sure.&nbsp;</div><div>As my canoeing ends for the season, I'm going to bring the bike back up and strength training as well. I'll definitely want to do a few good strength sessions a week. Then I'll start strength training at the club and push my maximum lifts a bit. Then when winter comes, I'll start adding in some skiing. Skiing twice a week at Mooney's. Two ski, two club strength, two home strength, three bike. I'd be in pretty decent shape for when paddling season comes back in the spring. There might even be some chance to do sessions on the ergo. That would be awful. Useful though.&nbsp;</div><div>If I can do a combined weight and ergo session program, I will. That might cost about $600 dollars so start saving a bit.&nbsp;</div><div>From now:</div><div><b>August - October</b> paddle, bike, light strength and core</div><div><b>October - November</b> increase bike, increase core</div><div><b>November - April </b>strength, core, ergo, bike</div><div><b>January - April&nbsp;</b>same as above, exchange bike for ski</div><div><b>May - October</b> paddle and bike</div><div>I definitely want to get Mara more engaged with  skiing. She enjoys it so much. </div><h2 data-label="243591" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 7, 2019</h2><div>I did my Wednesday double-workout morning. Bike and canoe. Just a half hour for each, but it all adds up. There's also the half hour of riding to and from the club. Even if I don't count it, my body does.&nbsp;</div><div>I was able to get into and maintain a pretty good race position on the bike for the zone 4 intervals. 1 minute is not very long and 220 watts is not very high so it's not too difficult. I'm slightly confused about my pedalling. Should I try to create a certain pedal stroke by focusing on a particular phase of the stroke? Or should I be more flexible and keep exploring all around the stroke? My inclination is to the latter. It's always better to be more flexible and more open-ended about things. </div><div><b>Alright</b>, now for something completely different. I just read an article that suggests speaking about yourself in the third person has some significant benefits for intellectual and emotional health. So let's give it a go!</div><div>Christopher has been working very hard at his training. He's been focusing on canoeing, but still doing quite a bit of cycling. It's hard work but he's enjoying it. He's still a bit frustrated and disappointed that he hasn't really lost any weight. Christopher struggles with his confidence and with his self esteem. He really does suffer a lot of stress. Confusingly, he keeps creating situations where he's going to be stressed. That's a more difficult conversation though. What should Christopher do? He shouldn't try and rush to short-term gains. If canoeing is the most important, then he should focus on canoeing. That would include Christopher canoeing as often as possible. In addition to that, he should try and get some more rest. He's very tired most days. If he's canoeing and resting then the next thing he should do is work on core strength. Maybe he should get out some of his old core workouts from Chris Lindsay from last winter? Yes, that's a good idea. His biggest struggle is his confidence. That's what makes it hard for him to make decisions and hard for him to stick with things. And to be patient with himself. He's really come a long way. He still has some things to work on. Maybe this will help him. The most important thing is to keep going on things. Not to keep restarting and changing course. Not second-guessing. Just keep going. Canoeing has been so good for Christopher. He really needed it so badly. He needed something challenging, but that he could get better at. This is not quite the place for this but I'll ask the question nevertheless; should Christopher keep working on data science? I'll just ask that question again and Christopher can observe whatever feeling seems to come up.</div><div>Should Christopher keep working on data science?</div><div>He probably should. He should not pursue it to the detriment of other activities though. Christopher will get more benefit from sports, guitar, and reading than from fiddling with techie things. </div><div>This feels really weird, but it's supposedly good for Christopher, so he'll keep trying.</div><div>It's very important for Christopher to be kind and compassionate with himself though not too indulgent. For every extreme, there's its opposite and the swing between polarities is destabilizing and counterproductive. The harder and more judgmental Christopher is on himself, the more indulgent he'll need to be to have stability and stasis. The indulgence leads to more harsh criticism and back and forth in perpetuum. Christopher is really excited about canoeing right now. It's hard to keep excitement and enthusiasm going. He may finally be surfacing out of the depression that he's been dealing with over the last year, though. There might be a lot more excitement and enthusiasm all around. A lot more energy and confidence. </div><div>Christopher is very interested in a kind of mastery of himself. Whether guitar playing, cycling, or canoeing his efforts are very focused on himself. On improvement, on mastery, on self development. It's important for Christopher to remember to include others. To share his successes as well as his failures. To share his activities with others. It's ok that Christopher doesn't enjoy team sports. It's ok that he likes solitary pursuits. That's all fine. But let others in.</div><h2 data-label="380990" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 8, 2019</h2><div>A hard but good paddle this morning. I still haven't figured my verbs out yet. I cycle, I bike, but I don't pedal. I canoe, I paddle. It doesn't really matter but it's interesting for me. I like canoeing. I like cycling. In one I paddle; the other I pedal. Clear enough. </div><div>Starting again, A hard but good canoe this morning. That's two canoe sessions in a row without tipping. I was feeling a bit tired and sore this morning. I think my cycling workout on Saturday is going to be really hard. All of the RPE of my workouts so far have been about 4, this one will be a 7. I mean realistically, my workouts have at times been much higher than 4, but SPOK'D&nbsp;<i>thought</i> they were a 4. This one they think is a 7. More than that, I'm going to be tired by the time I get there. I'm tired today. I should do some good stretching and rollers tonight. </div><div>I'm starting to turn another corner of ability. I can now take a couple of strokes continuously. It's still hard to keep going in a straight line. I should do a bit more up and down the lanes. </div><div>Yesterday, I tried writing in the third person. It was weird. I didn't like it and I don't think I'll do it again. </div><div>There's always the question when one is journalling of how to address oneself. Do you speak to yourself or about yourself or as yourself? I should probably always write as myself. I'll make an effort to do that from now on. It makes it a lot harder to talk in generalities. </div><div>One thing that made a huge difference this morning was consciously pushing back with my left foot. So the power of the stroke is coming from my leg and not from my arms. More accurately it's a whole kinetic chain involving my entire body. It's definitely not just my arms though. Considering that, I should probably do some more kinetic chain strength exercises such as deadlifts (a great exercise all around) and hang cleans. Deadlifts are great for cycling strength as well. </div><div>Earlier in the year (January, February), I was always writing down all the stats from my workouts on Zwift. I've stopped doing that. It's helpful though. Revise that. It has helped me though. Whenever I can, I will try and write as myself and I will try and avoid general and vague language or grammatical constructions.&nbsp; </div><div>Back to Zwift.&nbsp;</div><div>Since I started on Zwift on December 24th, 2018, I've:</div><ul><li>Ridden 2,272 kilometres (nearly the distance from Ottawa to Florida)</li><li>Climbed 24,586 metres (three times the height of Mount Everest)</li><li>Burned 54,720 calories (about 15 pounds worth)</li><li>Spent a total of 4 days and 3 hours on the bike</li><li>Reached a level of 18 (I'm not sure how high the levels go)</li><li>Completed 36% or 18,301 of 50,000 metres of the extended Everest challenge to get a Tron bike</li></ul><h2 data-label="361454" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 9, 2019</h2><div>No canoeing this morning. No cycling this morning. Not enough sleep and I needed my rest. I'll probably feel rested enough for some easy strength training this evening.</div><div>So no stats to report this morning. Just got enough sleep. Well not really enough, but just not too little.</div><div>I'm going to be off for a week. That's going to give me quite a few more opportunities to train. Most importantly I want to canoe four times. I also want to cycle four times and do strength four times.&nbsp;</div><div>Should I separate strength and core? How much time should I spend on stretching and recovery (rollers). If I work on strength, how many exercises should I do? I'll never forget Bruce Holzman's advice about practising that it's better to do one thing a million times than a million things once. I had pretty good success with that tactic and pushups. It's important to have some variety though. A balanced approach. </div><h2 data-label="691193" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 19, 2019</h2><div>Just came back from a week off of work. Not a week off of training though. In fact, I did some very good hard training sessions this week. I also had some of my most successful canoe sessions so far. I was at the cottage this weekend so didn't do any formal training sessions but I spent a lot of time noodling around in the canoe and paddled pretty damn hard. I have a really great feel for the water. With the difficulty of learning to balance in&nbsp; a C1, I had forgotten how apt I really am in a canoe. As my balance improves, that feel for the water will come back and I'll have some very good control and finesse.</div><div>I remember two years ago when I saw a guy bring a C1 down to the dock, climb in, and paddle away down the river and I thought that was the coolest thing and that was my dream. Well guess what? I can do that now! Now my dreams have moved further down the road. It's so important to acknowledge these moments when you realize that you've actually accomplished something. The endless difficulty of sports means that you're always looking ahead and striving towards something. It's very easy to forget that you actually pass those imaginary milestones every once in a while and it's essential to recognize that progress. </div><div>I was pretty flat on the bike this morning. I didn't even come close to finishing my workout. I've shifted my bike training to a longer-term plan to end about where paddling will start next spring. One thing that I'll have to do is lose some weight. It's a psychological and physical burden to carry extra weight. I'd like to be a lean 175 lbs in the spring. Losing weight is fairly easy in principle: simply burn more calories than you consume and for roughly every 3500 calories of deficit, you'll lose a single pound. Great. 3500 calories is actually quite a lot considering that I mostly burn 300-400 in a workout. I'll need to do a lot more. If burning 100 calories takes me roughly ten minutes then burning 3500 calories would take nearly 6 hours of cycling. If I do 3 hours a week and don't overeat, I could possibly drop the extra 15 lbs by March. Allowing for setbacks, sickness, and bad weeks, I'll give myself 37 weeks, the length of my current plan, to lose the 15 lbs. I'll aim to cycle 3 hours a week. In addition, I'll do strength and core training and eventually erg then finally ski training. Don't forget the mental side of training. Visualization and imagery are very powerful. I want to refine the image of what I want, of what I want to be. </div><div>Consistency is the most important thing. Don't overtrain, don't restart. Trust in your progress. Trust the plan. Commit to the long-term. To get fit, to lose weight, it all takes time. There are going to be good workouts and bad. Fatigue, sickness, even injury. Mental fatigue, low periods, stress, frustration, unrealistic expectations, boredom, distraction, pain. All of this is part of training. It's part of sports. It's part of life. Winter is long and cold. Everyone gets sick. Having some effective mental training will help see me through the tough times until I'm back on the water in the spring. </div><div>I hope to do 20 more canoe sessions this year. I don't actually think it will be that much, but I hope to. 4 this week. None next. Then hopefully four good weeks in September with 4 sessions each. That would make 20. Realistically it will be closer to 16 I suspect. That would still be a great run. That's about what I've done since the end of the introductory class and even that small amount of work has been an enormous transformation. I can actually paddle now! </div><div>In various ways I've done a lot of mental training over the years. Sometimes in a very effective way, others less so. I do have some aptitude for it. Alexander technique, Shearer's recent work, to some extent Iznaola, are all predicated on what Shearer calls the dominant role of the mind. </div><div>We have various, for lack of a better word, structures for understanding our world (is concepts a better word?). I call these structures ontology, Deleuze calls them the medium of representation, I think we mean the same thing. </div><div><i>There are four principal  aspects  to  ‘reason’  in  so  far  as  it  is  the  medium  of  representation:  identity,  in  the  form  of  the  undetermined concept;  analogy,  in  the  relation  between  ultimate  determinable concepts;  opposition,  in  the  relation  between  determinations within  concepts;  resemblance,  in  the  determined object  of  the  concept  itself.  These  forms  are  like  the  four  heads  or  the  four  shackles  of  mediation.  </i></div><div>Without getting too distracted by this question, I just wanted to mention this as a preamble to my real point that there's another way of looking at the world and that's through its materiality. This change in perspective is often alarmingly different. Often the structures of these concepts, of historicity and semiotics, of mediation, whatever are a screen for dealing with the world. The unmediated physical reality is never totally available, but it's much more available than we'd like to believe. </div><div>OK, back to training. I'm thinking about getting three little balance disks and putting them in a row to practice my balance for C1. Maybe I'll come back to that later. </div><div>The important thing I have to do tonight is to put a good inner tube in the front wheel of my Argon 18. My old bike (also an Argon 18) is falling apart. Probably beyond what's worth repairing. I still need a bike 20 or so more times this summer and fall though. I'm not sure how I'm going to come and go from the club in the winter. That could be a bit annoying. Anyway, for now a little bit about mental training:</div><div>3. Goals and Commitment</div><div>Successful athletes:</div><ul><li>Set long-term and short-term goals that are realistic, measurable, and time-oriented.</li><li>Are aware of their current performance levels and are able to develop specific, detailed plans for attaining their goals.</li><li>Are highly committed to their goals and to carrying out the daily demands of their training programs.</li></ul><div> This is interesting because, as I mentioned in an earlier entry, there's some equivocation about whether goal oriented behaviour is really the most effective. Most of my goals tend to be about just completing my workouts. There's some reason in that. The larger goals are implicit in the training program so the daily emphasis is just to do it. I now have some goals about losing weight as well. I've had trouble being effective in my weight loss.</div><h2 data-label="147094" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 20, 2019</h2><div>So my last day has been a complete disaster. Mara and the boys have been away for one day and I completely unraveled. OK, that's a bit dramatic. I didn't completely unravel. I did give in to my less productive impulses shall we say. I really am hooked on canoeing to the point that if I can't do it, I self-destruct. That was what started it all. I decided that I couldn't leave Freddie on his own so I wouldn't be able to paddle. Then I just gave up. It's certainly not the end of the world. It was just a day of lost training. Every day counts though. I didn't have a bad time, but I probably should have gone to bed early and read my book and got some rest. I was very tired yesterday morning and staying up until 2:00 AM doesn't help at all. I hope they come home tonight so I can go canoeing in the morning. I definitely rely on the routine and stability of family life. Though it has its restrictions, it's the very best life for me. I'm very glad I didn't go out and do stupid things. There's a time I would have done that. I'm very happy to be free from feeling like I have to do that sort of thing. I'm very happy that they went and are having a good time. I'll be very happy to have them home again. I needed canoeing in my life very badly. </div><div>Tomorrow's another day. The sun will come up–though a little later than before–and I'll get back in the boat and keep at it. </div><div>8 core exercises:</div><ul><li>crunch</li><li>leg push</li><li>left side crunch</li><li>right side crunch</li><li>back extension arms</li><li>back extension legs</li><li>bicycles </li><li>leg lifts</li></ul><h3 data-label="938294" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">A Balanced Approach</h3><div>With all the restrictions on my time and energy, I can't do everything every day. That wasn't a very healthy life for me anyway when I could do everything. It's important to manage expectations and to do workouts well and move on rather than trying to neurotically squeeze in little mini-pseudo workouts. Right now the priority is the canoe. There's such a small window of opportunity for canoeing that I have to do as much as I can while it's possib</div>
