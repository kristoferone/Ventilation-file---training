<div>As I'm becoming a more fluent paddler, I'm starting to work harder in the canoe. Still no where close to where I am on the bike. Canoe is much more technical and difficult than biking. I can still improve a lot in my cycling as well. I have a double workout tomorrow morning: bike at 5:00, canoe at 6:00. With an additional half hour of bike commuting to and from the club. That's a busy, active morning. I did it last week and it's definitely possible if I get to bed at a reasonable hour. </div><div>To improve my cycling, and let's be honest, I just want to look fast ;) To make some real improvements, I think I have to work on my position on the bike. I should begin to do my intervals in a racing position. I stopped going in the drops over the last little while because my gut was getting in the way. How mortifying! That's disgraceful. Oh well, trying, trying, trying. </div><div>What's a good racing position? Hands in the drops, arms bent, body low, power from the lower back, focus on the push part of the pedal stroke, cadence at least 90 rpm or higher, neck relaxed. Tomorrow morning I have a perfect workout to practice: 3 x 1 minute, zone 4. Zone 4 is over 220 watts so there's a bit of pressure on the pedal. Sit up during recovery. </div><div>I'm going to try and structure my canoe sessions a little more. I want to do about 2 kms a session. So if I go out 200 metres and back five times, that will be 2 kms. It's been fine to just noodle about for now, but I need to create some mental obstacles to overcome. This morning I was ready to stop after about 20 minutes. Mostly because there wasn't any real point to what I was doing apart from paddle, try not to tip. Of course the turning is always the hard part. Maybe I should try and find the 500 metre mark. That would mean a little more on the straight and fewer turns. I think that would be effective. </div><div>Tonight I'm going to do a strength and core workout. Push ups and chin ups for </div>
