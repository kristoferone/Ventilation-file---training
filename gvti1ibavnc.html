<div>With numbers like this, I'll be around 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups in a workout, which is a pretty reasonable volume. </div><div>My weight is still increasing. I haven't been able to make any headway. My cycling training plan is also quite light at the moment so I'm not burning a huge number of calories. This is hard and I feel slightly frustrated. I would like to be leaning down and I still have a gut. The question is whether I squeeze in extra workouts or trust my training plan. I think my plan is quite light this week. There may be a good reason for that though. Next week might be a bear and I'll need to rest up. I should stick with my training plan. It is totally reasonable to add some extra recovery rides in on the rest days. Active recov</div>
