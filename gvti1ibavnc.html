<div>With numbers like this, I'll be around 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups in a workout, which is a pretty reasonable volume. </div><div>My weight is still increasing. I haven't been able to make any headway. My cycling training plan is also quite light at the moment so I'm not burning a huge number of calories. This is hard and I feel slightly frustrated. I would like to be leaning down and I still have a gut. The question is whether I squeeze in extra workouts or trust my training plan. I think my plan is quite light this week. There may be a good reason for that though. Next week might be a bear and I'll need to rest up. I should stick with my training plan. It is totally reasonable to add some extra recovery rides in on the rest days. Active recovery is better than actual days off. There are a number of benefits including the physiological. It would be extra time on the bike and extra calories burned. Both good things. It would also keep me from being too anxious about not doing more workouts. OK, I'll do 30 minutes of recovery on Friday. Scratch that. Because we're going to the cottage, I'll actually have to do Sunday's workout on Friday to complete my plan for this week.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="996353" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 11, 2019</h2><div>Still on track for my training! Still way off on my weight loss! Boo. This has been a light week for cycling and that doesn't help much. I'm sticking with my SPOK'D plan. </div><div>The good news is that I'm doing very well at sticking with week two of my strength and core conditioning program. Today I did,</div><ul><li>AA core routine  week 2</li><li>Ball stability core routine week 2 (week 1 of the plan repeated to align with AA plan)</li><li>Push-ups in sets of 10, 250 total</li><li>Cycling workout (an extremely light 23 minutes)</li></ul><h2 data-label="539410" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 12, 2019</h2><div>Still on track! (mostly)</div><div>I'm nearly done week 2 of my first phase of training. I need to get out of bed about 20 minutes earlier in order to get through my workouts in full. My priorities are as follows core, bike, strength, flexibility and recovery. That simply means I do things in that order so that if I run out of time, I've already the most important things for the day. The problem is that, if I'm missing strength consistently, I won't make the kind of progress I want and I'll need to re-evaluate my goals slightly.&nbsp;</div><div>I regret stopping canoeing so early. I probably could have got another few weeks if not a month in. I'm not sure why I got nervous again. I'm self-conscious that I don't have the right gear. I'd like to get the right gear, but I'd also like to get a bit leaner to look good in that gear. My goal is still 175 lbs by the spring. I don't quite know how to get on that path right now. I think that I should stick to my cycling plan as the way to improve my fitness measure by my FTP and not for my weight. For weight, I'll need to cut back on my caloric intake. If I want to get thinner, I need to diminish my dinner. I've resisted that because of my obsessive tendencies. I'm going to stay home tomorrow. I didn't organize things with my dad to pick up the boys. So I'm going to just call in sick. </div><div>&nbsp;This morning:</div><ul><li>AA core routine  week 2</li><li>Ball stability core routine week 2 (week 1 of the plan repeated to align with AA plan)</li><li>Pull-ups in sets of 2, 20 total</li><li>Cycling workout (again, an extremely light 23 minutes)</li></ul><h2 data-label="116462" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 16, 2019</h2><div>I got up and did m workouts despite being slightly hungover.
