<div>With numbers like this, I'll be around 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups in a workout, which is a pretty reasonable volume. </div><div>My weight is still increasing. I haven't been able to make any headway. My cycling training plan is also quite light at the moment so I'm not burning a huge number of calories. This is hard and I feel slightly frustrated. I would like to be leaning down and I still have a gut. The question is whether I squeeze in extra workouts or trust my training plan. I think my plan is quite light this week. There may be a good reason for that though. Next week might be a bear and I'll need to rest up. I should stick with my training plan. It is totally reasonable to add some extra recovery rides in on the rest days. Active recovery is better than actual days off. There are a number of benefits including the physiological. It would be extra time on the bike and extra calories burned. Both good things. It would also keep me from being too anxious about not doing more workouts. OK, I'll do 30 minutes of recovery on Friday. Scratch that. Because we're going to the cottage, I'll actually have to do Sunday's workout on Friday to complete my plan for this week.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="996353" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 11, 2019</h2><div>Still on track for my training!
