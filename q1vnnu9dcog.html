<div>Yes, I'm going to do this. I'm going to skip my gradual progression and jump straight into this program. After the first two week segment, I'll need to find a new timer. Bit Timer is great but it only goes up to 4-minute intervals and I'll need 10-minute ones. </div><div>That will start on Tuesday though. </div><div>I think I did OK with my focus this morning. I focused largely on where my hips were touching the ground. That was alright. I'm still quite there yet. I think maybe my distraction is a bit, um distracting. I think it still does me some good. </div><div>Tomorrow I've got bike and strength. I'm going to continue with the Dynamic Cyclist Strength routine. I think it's pretty good and definitely pushes endurance. </div><h2 data-label="580793" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 9, 2019</h2><div>No training this morning. My stomach was upset and I was feeling pretty tired. I tried to meditate and felt just too agitated and restless to do anything. Nevertheless I am very excited about my erg workout tonight. I hope my stomach is feeling all the way back to normal. </div><div>I had a great week of training last week. I felt like I was working hard but not struggling. I'm also really happy about how my physique is looking. So definitely keep going. </div><div>Now that I feel like things are really clicking and that I'm actually getting fit and strong, this might be a good moment to have a look at my short-term goals and what I'd like to accomplish. </div><div>I'm a bit frustrated to lose a morning of training today, but that's the way it works. </div><div>A couple of things I've been working really hard on are meditation, stretching, and rollers. I think those are really good things. My core has moved into the next phase. Actually my next big block of training will take me just about up to March break and Montebello. That's pretty good timing because I want to be able to show off my physique a bit then. That will also give me time to do another block of training to the start of canoeing season. </div><div>I should probably break my training into two blocks of 6 weeks. It's easier to keep focus over a shorter time frame. </div><div>Everything is really starting to click. If I think about where I was this time last year, so out of shape and discouraged, to where I am now, it's an incredible distance. I'm really proud of myself and the hard work I've done. </div><div>So the focus for the next phase is on endurance core with smaller amounts of stability and lower core. </div><div>Bike three times a week, zone 4-5, really push on the zone 5. </div><div>Strength is a bit more complicated. I definitely want to keep working on pull-ups and reach my goal of 10 pull-ups in a row. I also want to make the most use of Dynamic Cyclist that I can which means stretching, strength, rollers, and functional strength. The last couple of workouts I've tried of theirs have been really good and hard. I just worry that I'm not doing enough heavy resistance training. Dead-lifts are the king of exercises. </div><div>Canoeing is the key, the focus, the reason for everything else. I really want to look like a sprint canoer and wear the right kind of outfit. Vain I know, but that's what I want. For that, I do have to generally lean down all over and bulk up in a few spots - shoulders, chest, bum. </div><div>Now the thing about having improved so much in a very short time (a year is actually a fairly short time), is that it makes me wonder what else I could accomplish if I put my mind to it? What would I like to have accomplished by this time next year? I can definitely see a lot of room for continued progress with my canoeing. But in other areas of my life? What would I like to look back on this time next year and say 'wow, I've come a really long way.'? Is it the intersection of design, development, UX, and data and cultural/arts sector research and policy? React and D3, Figma and Storybook, Zeroheight and Github? I think that is really the direction I want to go in. </div><div>Over to <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/78218/articles/399462-data-visualization?mode=edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data viz for this.</a></div><div>What about my guitar playing? </div><div>Anyway, back to my athletic pursuits. Tomorrow is core. I need to get up very early because I think my workout will take nearly two hours. </div><div>I need to inflate my stability ball tonight so it's ok in the morning. I'll have a look for any other leaks while I'm at it. </div><div>The emphasis for core is the rhythm in sync with my breathing and keep up good form through the whole set. Keep focus flowing steadily through feet, pelvis, solar plexus, chest, neck, head, and hands. Up and down steadily. </div><div>For stability, I'll work on some exercises from phase 2. They're good and hard, but very rewarding. </div><div>I don't have to do everything at once. I just have to maintain a balanced approach that will move me towards my goals. I've already achieved so much. I've already achieved goals, moved on to new goals and achieved those. </div><div>I can do anything I put my mind to. </div><div>When I'm down and low I don't feel like I have any power over even the smallest parts of my life. I feel like I have no agency. Even worse than that I feel like I'm a victim trapped within myself. At the mercy of behaviours and impulses that I can't control. </div><div>When I'm feeling better, I feel like I can do anything. Here as in other times of my life, it's athletic training that's given me the path to this feeling. Also meditation and visualization. The two feed off of each other. </div><div>I should get some elastic resistance bands as well. </div><div>I'm really feeling no motivation at all for my work life. I think I felt like this as well with my training not very long ago. I was pretty frustrated and discouraged with my progress for quite a long time. What finally worked was that I started paddling and feeling super motivated by that and the possibility that I could actually do it. I think there's too much uncertainty. It's hard to make decisions. </div><div>It's daily work that makes the difference. Sometimes it's not even a question of a huge amount of work every day. Just enough to create a base you can build on in the future. </div><div>Anyway, back to my training. I need to plan carefully to make sure I'm getting everything done. 1 erg session, 3, bike sessions, 3 core sessions, 3 strength sessions, meditation and stretching every (most) day(s). Core and strength sessions are made up of exchanges: small workouts that can be put together with other workouts. So a DC workout is an exchange. As the name suggests, I can <i>exchange</i> them with others. Tomorrow is a big core focus:</div><ul><li>Meditation - 12 min</li><li>DC core -30 min</li><li>Endurance core - 70 min</li><li>Stability - 10 min</li><li>DC stretching - 15 min</li></ul><div>OK, to get all that done before getting Mara up, I have to start at 4:30 in the morning. That's probably not possible. I'll try though. As long as I get to bed at a reasonable time, I'll be able to get up quite early. </div><div>I'm already tired, so getting to bed early shouldn't be too hard. </div><div>It'll be really interesting to see how my core and stretching help me endure my erg workouts week after week.&nbsp; </div><h2 data-label="503184" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 10, 2019</h2><div>Another great workout on the erg last night! I'm starting to really get the movement in my hips. It's such a difference from even a few weeks ago. I got through my workout pretty well with only a small loss in form because of fatigue. Now that I'm getting the movement going well in my hips, I'm going to focus on my arms next week. As long as I don't lose the right movement in my hips. I don't really have a great model for my technique. Maybe Martin Fuksa is a good one because we're a similar build. I think we're the same height. A lot of top canoers are pretty tall. Fuksa is also <u>very</u> fast with what people describe as perfect technique. I find him slightly off-putting as a person but honestly I'm not sure why. </div><div>I have the impression that top-level canoers are not rotating as much through their upper body as coaches seem to think they should. It's a more direct movement. I'll have a good look at Isaquias Dos Santos as well. Also very fast and not super tall. I have the impression that he's got a very high stroke rate and stays at the front of his boat a lot. </div><div>Well, I did it. I got up at 4:30 to do my huge, long core workout. I did the DC functional strength core workout which was very good and very challenging. Then I did my very long endurance core workout which takes about 70 minutes. </div><div>I think that it's not so much a question of rotating my whole upper body but more rotating the right side around my left. </div><div>That simplifies the movement a lot. And also makes it a lot more stable. </div><div>I felt pretty good in my workout this morning. I definitely have a long way to go before I actually have a really strong core and really good flexibility. I'm working at it though. I think Dynamic Cyclist will actually turn out to be a really good thing for me. </div><div>Tomorrow is strength and bike. So my same routine of beginning with meditation and ending with stretching. In between I'll do at least one strength exchange. It could be DC or Fitbod. Possibly both. Again to do all of that, I'd need to get up at about 4:30 again. That's pretty rough and maybe not enough sleep. We'll see. Another possibility is to do the weight circuit that I created for myself. </div><div>That's what I'll do. My own routine. I'll get up at 5:00 as usual. </div><ul><li>5:00 - 5:15 coffee</li><li>5:15 - 5:30 meditation</li><li>5:30 - 6:00 strength</li><li>6:00 - 6:30 bike</li><li>6:30 - 6:50 stretch</li></ul><div>That's reasonable. It's actually a lot easier than the workout I did today. I love my bike workout for tomorrow: 3 one-minute intervals in zone 5. That's a super-satisfying workout. It's hard but you can really push it without feeling like you're overdoing it.&nbsp;</div><div>Of course I'll do my pull-up workout as well. I think I'm going to mix in some eccentric contraction pull-ups as well. That's when you use a stool and start in the 'up' position and lower yourself down. It's much easier than full pull-ups so you can do more but they have an insidious little bite to them. </div><div>I'm still not feeling super awesome on the bike. I know I'm not doing very much work on the bike but still I don't feel very strong. I feel like I'm not applying power well. Again the answer is probably in visualization and focused concentration. </div><div>So what sort of power can I put out for one-minute intervals? Can I do 400 watts? Maybe. What if I crank up the level to 7 or 8? Really lay the power down. I really wish Zwift didn't have that weird bug. </div><div>Alright, in terms of focus for tomorrow. For deadlifts I'm going to do them continuously rather than resetting for each one. For one-arm rows, stand on both feet, emphasize rotating the lifting shoulder around the static one. For roll-outs, focus on the hips, go to positive failure. Push-ups to failure it doesn't matter how many, keep going way past comfort. Each exercise to failure (careful with deadlifts!). Recover for 2 minutes in between. Try for 4 sets at least. This will hopefully help build some more muscle. I want to get to 42% muscle. That will hopefully invert my fat and muscle lines on the graph. </div><div>Before I jump in to heavyish dead-lifts I should probably warm up a bit. I think some steady kettle-bell swings will do the trick.&nbsp; </div><h2 data-label="329650" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 11, 2019</h2><div>I twinged my back doing deadlifts this morning. It's not too bad and I think it will be fine by tomorrow but it it was a stern reminder of how things can easily go wrong. I rely on day-after-day training to achieve my goals, I can't be out of commission because of a back injury. In fact, I want everything to get stronger and stronger and an injury is antithetical to that. So I've made a decision that I won't do any more of the strength training I've been doing anymore. I'm going to switch entirely to Dynamic Cyclist strength workouts and </div><div></div><div></div>
