<div>Yes, I'm going to do this. I'm going to skip my gradual progression and jump straight into this program. After the first two week segment, I'll need to find a new timer. Bit Timer is great but it only goes up to 4-minute intervals and I'll need 10-minute ones. </div><div>That will start on Tuesday though. </div><div>I think I did OK with my focus this morning. I focused largely on where my hips were touching the ground. That was alright. I'm still quite there yet. I think maybe my distraction is a bit, um distracting. I think it still does me some good. </div><div>Tomorrow I've got bike and strength. I'm going to continue with the Dynamic Cyclist Strength routine. I think it's pretty good and definitely pushes endurance. </div><h2 data-label="580793" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 9, 2019</h2><div>No training this morning. My stomach was upset and I was feeling pretty tired. I tried to meditate and felt just too agitated and restless to do anything. Nevertheless I am very excited about my erg workout tonight. I hope my stomach is feeling all the way back to normal. </div><div>I had a great week of training last week. I felt like I was working hard but not struggling. I'm also really happy about how my physique is looking. So definitely keep going. </div><div>Now that I feel like things are really clicking and that I'm actually getting fit and strong, this might be a good moment to have a look at my short-term goals and what I'd like to accomplish. </div><div>I'm a bit frustrated to lose a morning of training today, but that's the way it works. </div><div>A couple of things I've been working really hard on are meditation, stretching, and rollers. I think those are really good things. My core has moved into the next phase. Actually my next big block of training will take me just about up to March break and Montebello. That's pretty good timing because I want to be able to show off my physique a bit then. That will also give me time to do another block of training to the start of canoeing season. </div><div>I should probably break my training into two blocks of 6 weeks. It's easier to keep focus over a shorter time frame. </div><div>Everything is really starting to click. If I think about where I was this time last year, so out of shape and discouraged, to where I am now, it's an incredible distance. I'm really proud of myself and the hard work I've done. </div><div>So the focus for the next phase is on endurance core with smaller amounts of stability and lower core. </div><div>Bike three times a week, zone 4-5, really push on the zone 5. </div><div>Strength is a bit more complicated. I definitely want to keep working on pull-ups and reach my goal of 10 pull-ups in a row. I also want to make the most use of Dynamic Cyclist that I can which means stretching, strength, rollers, and functional strength. The last couple of workouts I've tried of theirs have been really good and hard. I just worry that I'm not doing enough heavy resistance training. Dead-lifts are the king of exercises. </div><div>Canoeing is the key, the focus, the reason for everything else. I really want to look like a sprint canoer and wear the right kind of outfit. Vain I know, but that's what I want. For that, I do have to ge</div><div></div><div></div>
