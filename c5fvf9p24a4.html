A week without any entries is not a good thing. I haven't had a great week of training for sure. There are still some good things to report though. I've been doing well with my meditation practice. I think that's good for everything in my life. I've been productive in my data visualization practice as well and, though I don't think it's entirely up to meditation, it definitely helps. I think my cycling is reaching the end of the Foundation phase. Not a minute too soon! I want to do more short intense efforts. Grinding away on the bike is great if you want to win bike races. I just want to be fit for canoeing. I want to do sprints. I'm anticipating that next week will be recovery week and then I'll move into the next training phase. I'd really like  that.&nbsp;</div><div>I want short, hard workouts that make my muscles big and strong and leave me feeling exuberant and exhilarated.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="853292" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 4, 2019</h2><div>I had a reasonably good workout today. Something is weird between Zwift, Strava, and SPOKD. There was  substantially lower power reported on my upload than what the workout seemed a the time. Something's not right. I used to have to go up 4-5 gears in my workout, now I can do it all in the same. I'll try updating everything. I might need to replace the batteries in my trainer too. </div><div>I'm in a recovery week right now and beginning my&nbsp;erg training at the canoe club tonight. I'm a bit worried because I have a very sore back. I think I should take a bunch of painkillers to get through tonight. I want to get a reasonably good start to this program.&nbsp;</div><div>After this week, I should be moving into the next phase of my cycling training as well as my core training. I think for this phase, I'm going to put the stability ball training on hold and focus more on strength. Because I won't be doing strength training at the club, I'll need to find a way to get some good strength training. </div><div>This i</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
