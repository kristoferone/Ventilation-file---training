<div>The beginning of week 2! Last week was a great success. I'm going to try and stay on course and not get too over-excited. It's still a long way to go until the end of this block of training. Everything is on track. </div><div>I had a good workout this morning. I did two circuits of three minutes an exercise. I'm doing well with having set exercises but doing variations of them to keep a balance between consistency and variety. I keep giving myself challenges for my body to figure out around balance, stabilization, strength. I think this is a great approach rather than just repeating the same handful of exercises. I've been working on some progressions as well. I know that my lower back is a bit&nbsp; weak at times and is a limiting factor for certain exercises. So I'm working on slow progressions that will help build up my strength and coordination in order to be able to do the full exercise without risking injuring my&nbsp; back. I did two circuits today and tomorrow I can either do a third circuit or extend the length of each exercise. I wonder if I should increase circuits for the long workouts and increase the length for the shorter ones. In other words, tomorrow I'll do the same length for each exercise but do three circuits. The following day when I have a split core/bike day, I'll do only one circuit but increase the length of each exercise. That sounds like a plan. Ultimately the goal is to get up to that 10-minute length by the end of this block of training. I know I can do it. I've been up as high as seven minutes and at some point the time doesn't matter so much. </div><div>Back to this morning. I also did meditation as usual, push-ups, stretching, and pull-ups. All is going well. Well nearly. I'm having some pain in my right elbow. I think it started with the canoe erg but is getting aggravated by pull-ups. Last week Monday was also quite sore and hard but it improved a lot over the week. I hope that continues to be the case. I should definitely do some meditation to help it. I think that helped a lot when my back was hurting. The cool thing about my pull-ups is that I'm going to finish my current plan by the end of this week and complete 8 pull-ups in a row! Very cool! My goal is to more than double that by the end of this block of training. I have the other app on the go as well. That's only a six-week plan though so I'm worried it will progress too quickly. If it reaches a point that I can't keep up, I'll switch to negative pull-ups and continue building that way. </div><div>Push-ups will just keep chugging along. I'm still a while away from those workout becoming hard. </div><div>I've got erg tonight and I'm going to try and work with really good form the whole time. I'll try and hit perfect form for every single stroke. Really work with ADM and also with focused attention. Do some quiet visualizations in the recovery intervals. Smooth and consistent! Don't do anything that you wouldn't want to happen in the finals of Nationals. Keep performance as your goal.</div><div>My goals are pretty straightforward for this week: to stick with the plan. I want to get in at least two skis this week. I'd be even happier with three. Even if they're very short, it's so valuable to get out often. Actually frequent, short exposure is better than longer sessions less often. When I ski this week, I'm going to explore some more of the facility. The previous three visits I didn't leave the main field. I'll go explore the other fields and work up to doing the longer trail. Maybe I'll do one session as a technical focus and the next as a trail ski? So many possibilities. Even on a trail ski, I'll want to keep the focus on technique. </div><div>The important thing as always is to keep the focus on the best technique I can. And the way to do that is with ADM. Build habits of security and confidence. Keep performance as your goal. Performance in the form of racing. I want to get to the point that I can accurately and vividly visualize the entire course of a 500 metre race; every paddle stroke. </div><div>I have come a long way. I still have a distance to go, but I'm getting there. </div><div>I really hope Mara doesn't go bananas like she did last year. She's showing some signs, but I hope that between therapy and exercise she can keep her equilibrium. I'll have to tread carefully for a little bit. That was really hard. It was around late January, February, even March we were having trouble. I don't know why she was so unhappy with me. That was a terrible time. I don't want to repeat it.</div><div>OK, back to the here and now. I might be able to get out for skis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. If I do 30-45 minutes for each one that would be wonderful. I'm going to have to go to bed earlyish tonight, I have a tough and long workout to get through in the morning and I want to make sure I have the time I need to stretch. As it stands:</div><ul><li>Meditation - 10 minutes</li><li>Endurance core - 50 minutes</li><li>Pull-ups - 20 minutes</li><li>Stretching - 15 minutes</li></ul><div>That's very reasonable as long as&nbsp; I get enough sleep, set the coffee maker tonight. </div><div>I'm recovering much better from my erg workouts than I was before. That means I'm getting stronger. I'm not sure if it's the erg workouts themselves, my core work, stretching, or a combination of all of those things, but I'm definitely not as shattered afterwards as I have been. On the whole I'm getting in much better shape. </div><div>I'm happy and relieved that I don't indulge in the same distractions that I have been for so long. I think my training is better and I'm happier. I'm feeling a bit odd in that department, but nothing serious. Just a lack of interest more than anything. </div><h2 data-label="747783" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 21, 2020</h2><div>I had another really good erg session last night. It's a long road but I feel like I'm improving week after week. This week I want to focus on some good visualization sessions to really improve my focus and concentration for next week. Next week is going to be a hard workout and I want to make sure I've got a good focus to get through it all with the best form I can. I burned 1070 calories last night. That's already just over 30% of my goals for the week. I also did almost an hour-long core workout this morning which is about 250 calories or so.&nbsp;</div><div>My core workout went really well this morning. I did three circuits of three-minute intervals. It was challenging but felt really good. I'm constantly trying to challenge myself to do new and different things and I'm very pleasantly surprised by how quickly I'm adapting and able to accomplish new things. </div><div>My elbow is quite sore when I do pull-ups. Apparently this is a pretty common problem with pull-ups. I'll have to find a way through it. I believe that with time, strengthening, proper technique, and visualization I can fix this issue&nbsp;without having to lose too much ground. I think I can probably even achieve my goal of 20 pull-ups by March 6th. I've dealt with pain before. </div><div>I'm going to back off on the repetitions for now. Also just do negative pull-ups for the rest of the week. No pull-ups. Also only do pull-ups on alternating days to give myself a bit more rest time. </div><div>I'm going for a ski tonight. Nothing crazy just 30 minutes or so. Focus on technique. I'm going to go over to one of the other fields tonight to see what it's like. Glide, weight transfer, un-weighting the back foot, proper alternation of arms and legs. Like always start without poles, then poles, then double-poling.&nbsp;</div><div>I've got a 50/50 core and bike workout tomorrow. I'll only do one circuit of core but I'm going to bump the interval length up to four minutes. I've also got push-ups tomorrow and stretching. I have to remember that there's no rush to do push-ups too quickly. Form and technique are the most important thing as that is ultimately what will let me get to higher and higher numbers. </div><div>My body composition continues to move in the right direction. This is really important. I don't often acknowledge how much of my athletic goals are caught up with appearance; looking the part of being an athlete. That's hard to feel is true when you're overweight. That extends to gear as well. I want to look the part. How much of life is like that? That we're pursuing an image of an idealized version of ourselves. I'm not sure where that lies in my working life at all. Anyway, sports are working pretty well right now. </div><div>My visualization focus for canoeing this week is  reach. Really try and focus on that reach so that it will happen on Monday. </div><div>I have some weakness and lack of connection and coordination in my lower back that makes some exercises difficult or even risky for my lower back. So I've been working on building up the movements and strength gradually. I think it's going well. There's a lot of different things to try but the simplest is to just do one leg at a time. I'll stay working on this for some time. There's no rush to hurt my back again. The other good thing is that I can ramp up the duration quite a bit further than I could doing the full exercises. </div><div>One thing that's lacking from my core routine right now is rotation. I think I can incorporate it into a couple of places. My increasingly complex mountain-climbers, for example. Also, crunches. Maybe even bird-dogs. Even planks. It's very cool that there are so many possible variations of a few basic exercises. </div><div>I have a short, half-hour bike workout to do tomorrow. I'm going to pump up my tires tonight to make sure that the calibration continues to work well. I'm not going to look at power at all. </div><h2 data-label="149902" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 22, 2020</h2><div>I was quite tired while skiing last night. Despite that it was a very productive ski. Apparently I burned 449 calories which is a bit of a surprise indeed. I need a good skiing play mix. Classic skiing is very hard to do well. Keep trying. I think I'm improving. It definitely takes a bit of time. For perspective I've probably been out skiing, trying to improve my technique for about two hours this winter. That's really not very much time.&nbsp;Be patient and kind with yourself about where you are right now. You've already done more skiing than the last two years combined. If you keep getting out consistently, you will get better. If you stick with it, you will get good at it. There was a time not very long ago when you could barely stay up in a C1, now you can paddle well. </div><div>There you go. Keep at it.</div><div>OK, back to this morning. I stuck with just the three minute intervals for my endurance core. I think I'm going to refine my ongoing plans in light of what I'm doing now. I'm not sure. For now I'll keep progressing step by step. The question is if I want to drop any exercises as I go, how time I ultimately have to spend on core workouts, and finally if 10 minute intervals is really feasible. I do need to ramp up slightly this week in order to stay on track. I have another chance tomorrow to get a bit more work done. I'm glad I'm taking it slow with my v-ups. I'm still getting some clunking in my lower back if I'm not careful. Also I'm lacking a bit of flexibility in my legs that I notice when I'm extending. Keep stretching! I still have to be really careful and train my lower back to stay solid while I do different movements. I should start the interval by just stabilizing my TA. Then contract my upper body to engage my rectus abdominus, then work on movements. And of course if necessary reset my stability if I've lost that connection. In the long run this will be a more productive approach. </div><div>I'm a bit torn about what to do about my elbow pain. I should take some time off of doing pull-ups for a little while. Then gradually ease back in. I've made some very good progress and I'm not keen to lose ground. Especially since pull-ups are my primary source of strength training. I wonder if as an alternative I should do the ab roller for a while to let my elbow heal. I really, really don't want a chronic injury that might impact my canoeing this summer. Less strength is better than injured. I could also do pull-downs with the elastic band, Dynamic Cyclist style. I'll try both of those things. Stretching is important as well. As well as a slow, gradual ease back into pull-ups. One at a time. Focus on ADM. Also, try putting your hands just shoulder-wide. Just like with core, and everything else, I need to clarify in my mind all the movements before I try and do them. </div><div>I did some interesting work this morning with push-ups and ADM. What I did slightly differently was that I didn't just try and do the visualization, I settled my attention on part of my body</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
