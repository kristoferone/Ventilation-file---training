<div>The beginning of week 2! Last week was a great success. I'm going to try and stay on course and not get too over-excited. It's still a long way to go until the end of this block of training. Everything is on track. </div><div>I had a good workout this morning. I did two circuits of three minutes an exercise. I'm doing well with having set exercises but doing variations of them to keep a balance between consistency and variety. I keep giving myself challenges for my body to figure out around balance, stabilization, strength. I think this is a great approach rather than just repeating the same handful of exercises. I've been working on some progressions as well. I know that my lower back is a bit&nbsp; weak at times and is a limiting factor for certain exercises. So I'm working on slow progressions that will help build up my strength and coordination in order to be able to do the full exercise without risking injuring my&nbsp; back. I did two circuits today and tomorrow I can either do a third circuit or extend the length of each exercise. I wonder if I should increase circuits for the long workouts and increase the length for the shorter ones. In other words, tomorrow I'll do the same length for each exercise but do three circuits. The following day when I have a split core/bike day, I'll do only one circuit but increase the length of each exercise. That sounds like a plan. Ultimately the goal is to get up to that 10-minute length by the end of this block of training. I know I can do it. I've been up as high as seven minutes and at some point the time doesn't matter so much. </div><div>Back to this morning. I also did meditation as usual, push-ups, stretching, and pull-ups. All is going well. Well nearly. I'm having some pain in my right elbow. I think it started with the canoe erg but is getting aggravated by pull-ups. Last week Monday was also quite sore and hard but it improved a lot over the week. I hope that continues to be the case. I should definitely do some meditation to help it. I think that helped a lot when my back was hurting. The cool thing about my pull-ups is that I'm going to finish my current plan by the end of this week and complete 8 pull-ups in a row! Very cool! My goal is to more than double that by the end of this block of training. I have the other app on the go as well. That's only a six-week plan though so I'm worried it will progress too quickly. If it reaches a point that I can't keep up, I'll switch to negative pull-ups and continue building that way. </div><div>Push-ups will just keep chugging along. I'm still a while away from those workout becoming hard. </div><div>I've got erg tonight and I'm going to try and work with really good form the whole time. I'll try and hit perfect form for every single stroke. Really work with ADM and also with focused attention. Do some quiet visualizations in the recovery intervals. Smooth and consistent! Don't do anything that you wouldn't want to happen in the finals of Nationals. Keep performance as your goal.</div><div>My goals are pretty straightforward for this week: to stick with plan. I want to get in at least two skis this week. I'd be even happier with three. Even if they're very short, it's so valuable to get out often. Actually frequent, short exposure is better than longer sessions less often. When I ski this week, I'm going to explore some more of the facility. The previous three visits I didn't leave the main field. I'll go explore the other fields and work u</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
