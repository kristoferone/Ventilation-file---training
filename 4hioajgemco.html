<h2 data-label="510433" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 21, 2019</h2><div>I did a very short bike workout this morning. It's amazing that it had a perceptible effect on my mood. Less anxious, happier, music sounds better. There's an interesting balance then: if I don't train, I feel badly; if I over-train, I feel badly; if I train&nbsp;<i>just right</i>, I feel great. That seems reasonable enough. Hard in practice though. </div><div>Anyway, back to my morning workout. </div><div>To lose 15 lbs, I'll need to burn 52,500 calories&nbsp;<i>more</i> than I consume. This morning I burned 214 calories. This feels like the beginning of a long journey. </div><h2 data-label="246790" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 22, 2019</h2><div>Well I had a pretty awful canoe this morning. It was a combination of a whole bunch of factors: I was tired and didn't get enough sleep, there weren't any paddles so I had to make do with a weird carbon one that I didn't like at all and didn't fit, and I haven't canoed in a week. I'm feeling torn if I should paddle tomorrow morning or just let it go and start fresh in September. I'm really torn. The session this morning wasn't very good for my confidence. I felt frustrated and disappointed. I really should do it. If it's bad, it's bad. It's good to have some not great experiences in the bank too. They're not always going to be good days. </div><h2 data-label="861952" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 23, 2019</h2><div>I didn't canoe this morning. I thought it would be another bad one. I definitely wouldn't have the paddle I want and I might not have a suitable canoe. I think it was the right decision. I did a cycling workout instead. I didn't feel too badly. I didn't feel great either. I didn't have any trouble getting my power up and keeping it up but my legs felt really sore right after each interval and I had trouble getting my leg speed up and staying smooth. </div><div>So that's all the canoeing I'm going to do before September. So I'll be starting over again a little bit.</div><h2 data-label="418677" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 4, 2019</h2><div>I've come back from vacations in pretty terrible condition! I decided to wrap up my paddling for the season as I'm pretty sure after nearly two weeks off, I'd be starting fresh from nothing and back to tipping into the now-cold water. I don't have the gear for cold-weather paddling. So that's it for now! Time to look ahead to next season. Now's my chance to put in a good base and make some big fitness improvements ahead of next season. The goal is to start next canoeing season a lean, fit 175 lbs with good overall and core strength and stability. What I learned this year is that canoeing really, really rewards doing it a lot. If I paddle 5-6 times a week next summer, I'll be in pretty good form. Maybe even do some racing. CANMAS is definitely my goal. Maybe not next year. </div><div>So what are my plans? What's my training plan for the Fall/Winter? I'm definitely going to do strength and erg training at the club. That's the only way for me to do heavy lifting and exercises like bench pull. It will also keep me connected to the club. That's not enough though. Twice a week is not going to be quite enough for me to achieve my goals.&nbsp;</div><div>First, cycling: cycling is the best way for me to get fit and to lose weight. I have so much experience, I have the right setup and I have a decent base. I've been training fairly regularly since last December and that's a pretty substantial amount of work to draw upon for future training. I've committed to an ambitious 37 week sprint training plan. I do sprint because that's the most enjoyable and also the most transferable fitness to canoeing. I have two major goals for this training plan: a stable weight of 175 lbs, a 10% improvement in my FT</div><div></div><div><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Exercise</th> <th>Week 1</th> <th>Week 2</th> <th>Week 3</th> <th>Week 4</th> <th>Week 5</th> <th>Week 6</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Crunch</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Leg push</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Left side crunch</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Right side crunch</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Upper back extension</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Lower back extension</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Leg lifts</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bicycle</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> <td>12</td> <td>30</td> <td>20</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Number of circuits</b></td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>2</td> </tr></tbody></table></div>
