<h2 data-label="510433" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 21, 2019</h2><div>I did a very short bike workout this morning. It's amazing that it had a perceptible effect on my mood. Less anxious, happier, music sounds better. There's an interesting balance then: if I don't train, I feel badly; if I over-train, I feel badly; if I train&nbsp;<i>just right</i>, I feel great. That seems reasonable enough. Hard in practice though. </div><div>Anyway, back to my morning workout. </div><div>To lose 15 lbs, I'll need to burn 52,500 calories&nbsp;<i>more</i> than I consume. This morning I burned 214 calories. This feels like the beginning of a long journey. </div><h2 data-label="246790" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 22, 2019</h2><div>Well I had a pretty awful canoe this morning. It was a combination of a whole bunch of factors: I was tired and didn't get enough sleep, there weren't any paddles so I had to make do with a weird carbon one that I didn't like at all and didn't fit, and I haven't canoed in a week. I'm feeling torn if I should paddle tomorrow morning or just let it go and start fresh in September. I'm really torn. The session this morning wasn't very good for my confidence. I felt frustrated and disappointed. I really should do it. If it's bad, it's bad. It's good to have some not great experiences in the bank too. They're not always going to be good days. </div><h2 data-label="861952" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 23, 2019</h2><div>I didn't canoe this morning. I thought it would be another bad one. I definitely wouldn't have the paddle I want and I might not have a suitable canoe. I think it was the right decision. I did a cycling workout instead. I didn't feel too badly. I didn't feel great either. I didn't have any trouble getting my power up and keeping it up but my legs felt really sore right after each interval and I had trouble getting my leg speed up and staying smooth. </div><div>So that's all the canoeing I'm going to do </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
