<h2 data-label="584611" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 16, 2019</h2><div>87.9 kg or 194 lbs, 20.3 % fat, 41.4% muscle.&nbsp;</div><div>I did my core workouts plus roll-outs (27), push-ups(250), and pull-ups(30). Not an earth-shattering, monumental workout. Just ordinary. A little bit tired but got it done anyway. </div><div>Tomorrow will be a bike workout plus core.</div><div>I'm enjoying walking to work. I think it will help me get my weight down to where I'd like it to be. </div><h2 data-label="613924" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 17, 2019</h2><div>I think I'm stressed about work. I got on the bike but didn't even finish my warm-up. I felt tired and discouraged. I also just dicked around all morning before that and didn't do any core or strength either. Bah! I need to refocus for tomorrow and make sure to stay on track with my workouts. Sure, I'm going to end up missing two workouts this week, that's ok though. It's important to not let one off week set the tone for future weeks.&nbsp;</div><div>What I did that was positive though was to download Headspace again and do some meditation. It's hard to find the extra time in the morning for meditation but I think it's important. If I'm up at 5:00, I only have a maximum of about an hour and forty-five minutes. One of the solutions would be to move some of my strength training to the evening. Pull-ups are an obvious one to move as I can do them while watching TV. Stretching and pull-ups. That does take some of the pressure off of the morning. Another strategy is to cut the warm-up and cool-down periods of my cycling workouts to make more time. </div><div>My body stats today:</div><ul><li>weight 89.2 kg</li><li>fat 20.7</li><li>muscle 41.1</li></ul><h2 data-label="560431" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 21, 2019</h2><div>Well after a pretty rotten week last week, I felt pretty good on the bike this morning. I did my workout well with a consistently fast cadence and fairly smooth pedalling. I had a bit of oomph that was not there last week. I actually set 5 PRs this morning! Not bad at all. </div><div>So, tomorrow morning I'll have to be quite disciplined to get everything done that I want to. </div><ul><li>AA core</li><li>Stability ball core</li><li>Roll-outs</li><li>Push-ups</li><li>Meditation</li><li>Hang cleans</li></ul><div>I'm really going to try and start doing pull-ups and stretching in the evenings. I'm also really hoping to start doing some erg training at the canoe club in November. C1 erg is truly awful, but I really want to start the season well with good balance, good technique, good conditioning and endurance. </div><div>Alright, I've registered for erg training on Monday evenings. I'll wait until it's confirmed to tell Mara, but this really is the best for the family schedule. </div><div>I'm not feeling in great condition at the moment but that's okay. I feel like my core training has stagnated somewhat. I think I should take a couple of the stabilization exercises I do on the ball and do them on the mat as well. Plank, side plank, shoulder bridge. The ball is great and very challenging but I'm not sure I'm getting all the strength I can. That's also why I want to add more weight training into my routine. Push-ups are great for overall conditioning but they're time-consuming for the amount of actual strength gains you get from them. When I do weight training, I'll take exactly the same approach that I always do: sweet spot training. That is to find the optimal amount of work I can&nbsp;<i>repeat</i> continuously for a given amount of time. For example if I'm going to do 20 minutes with 1 min recovery between sets, I need to find an amount of weight and number of repetitions that make that possible.</div><h2 data-label="627830" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 22, 2019</h2><div>I had a pretty strong workout this morning. Last night I was able to do pull-ups and stretching and that frees up quite a bit of time in the morning. I still need to solidify my priorities a little bit. First cycling, then core, then strength, then stretching, then meditation, then recovery.</div><div>I'm going to try and more or less repeat my workout from this morning tomorrow. Core is definitely the highest priority on days when I'm not cycling. I think pull-ups are the most valuable strength exercise for me to do so I'm going to try and do a little bit every day. Last night I did 30 pull-ups. I took all of about 10 minutes. That leads me into another question that I've been thinking about. Can you move important things in your life forward with small, daily increments? 15 minutes a day, for example. Can I maintain and even improve my paddling strength with pull-ups on 15 minutes a day? What about my guitar playing? What about my mental and emotional strength and resilience? Can I learn something new? Can I master a skill? Can I reach my goals for my life 15 minutes at a time?</div><div>I think the answer to all these questions is yes. Obviously I won't play guitar at a concert level or become a data viz expert on 15 minutes a day. But I can improve slightly from where I am. </div><div>Tonight, I will again try and do pull-ups (about 30) and stretching. I'm also going to try and play my guitar for about 15 minutes. That's not really a training thing but it's part of theory. </div><div>One thing that I haven't fully explored recently is what Shearer calls the dominant</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
