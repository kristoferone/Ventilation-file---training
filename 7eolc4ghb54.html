<h2 data-label="584611" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 16, 2019</h2><div>87.9 kg or 194 lbs, 20.3 % fat, 41.4% muscle.&nbsp;</div><div>I did my core workouts plus roll-outs (27), push-ups(250), and pull-ups(30). Not an earth-shattering, monumental workout. Just ordinary. A little bit tired but got it done anyway. </div><div>Tomorrow will be a bike workout plus core.</div><div>I'm enjoying walking to work. I think it will help me get my weight down to where I'd like it to be. </div><h2 data-label="613924" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 17, 2019</h2><div>I think I'm stressed about work. I got on the bike but didn't even finish my warm-up. I felt tired and discouraged. I also just dicked around all morning before that and didn't do any core or strength either. Bah! I need to refocus for tomorrow and make sure to stay on track with my workouts. Sure, I'm going to end up missing two workouts this week, that's ok though. It's important to not let one off week set the tone for future weeks.&nbsp;</div><div>What I did that was positive though was to download Headspace again and do some meditation. It's hard to find the extra time in the morning for meditation but I think it's important. If I'm up at 5:00, I only have a maximum of about an hour and forty-five minutes. One of the solutions would be to move some of my strength training to the evening. Pull-ups are an obvious one to move as I can do them while watching TV. Stretching and pull-ups. That does take some of the pressure off of the morning. Another strategy is to cut the warm-up and cool-down periods of my cycling workouts to make more time. </div><div>My body stats today:</div><ul><li>weight 89.2 kg</li><li>fat 20.7</li><li>muscle 41.1</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
