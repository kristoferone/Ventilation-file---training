<div>Back to this morning, I did my core workout and it went so quickly and relatively easily that I went back and did a third set after my planned two. I then went on to pull-ups and felt noticeably tired after yesterday's pull-up workout. I may alternate pull-ups and push-ups then to keep from being too tired. I also did push-ups this morning. I was running short on time though, so I only did a few sets (60 push-ups total). So I think this confirms my theory that it's better to focus on one thing at a time and try to really reach failure rather than doing a little bit of a few things. Now how does that translate to my core workouts? Well it doesn't really at the moment. I'm doing anatomical adaptation which means it's not intended to be incredibly hard. It's general preparation for the harder work that will come soon enough. </div>
