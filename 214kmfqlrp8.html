<div>I'm going to use my cycling as a way of developing my baseline fitness. I'm still pretty good on a bike and I know how to use it to train. It won't be an end in itself though. </div><h2 data-label="443335" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 30, 2019</h2><div>Sick and tired. Maybe slightly overtrained. Overtrained is not quite the right word, it's actually overstressed. I still got out for a nearly two kilometre paddle this morning. I saw a guy coming down and hop into his canoe and paddle off down the river looking very calm, steady, and sure of himself. That's kind of my dream, my vision. First thing in the morning, quiet calm river, paddling off smoothly and powerfully. Sure of myself. </div><div>I'll get there.  Well I'll probably never really be sure of myself. I might appear that way though. </div><div>Onwards!</div><div>Now, for example if I were to take my list of exercises that I made yesterday and broke it into two, Day 1 and Day 2. I could do each twice a week. I could use a timer and do a set every minute for ten minutes each exercise. </div><div>Day 1:</div><ul><li>Pull ups x 2</li><li>Push ups x 10</li><li>Foot presses x 10</li><li>Bicycles x 10 (a repetition of both sides is a count of one: left side, right side 1; left side, right side 2; etc.)</li></ul><div>Day 2:</div><ul><li>Roll outs x 2 </li><li>Leg lifts x 10 </li><li>Supermans x 10 </li><li>Crunches x 10</li></ul><div>Again none of this will get me into top shape. It's just a step, the beginnings of a base. To be productive, you need frequent, low-stress contact with a project that you enjoy. But 45 minutes a workout, four workouts a week is still 3 hours a week. All in less time than it takes to watch Stranger Things. </div><h2 data-label="127155" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 31, 2019</h2><div>I was able to do both a bike workout and a paddle this morning. It was busy but definitely not impossible to do regularly. I think thirty minute paddling sessions are just about right. It gives me enough time to improve without getting too sore and tired. Frequent and low-stress exposure. One brick at a time. </div><div>C1 is so damn cool. I love it. </div><div>I've been doing a kind of paddle stroke then drag my paddle in a light feather. Obviously that's terrible for speed and efficiency but it has contributed to quite a bit more stability. </div><h2 data-label="299545" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 1, 2019</h2><div>I'm continuing to improve each time I go paddling. It's really very hard. I've been paddling different boats. I think I've found my favourite with the Nelo Vanquish III. I tipped this morning because of the wake from a coach's boat. I was a bit surprised that I went over. I had been getting much better, not just at my stability, but also at being able to save myself. Apparently the Vanquish is quite a bit more tippy than the Vintage IIIs I had been paddling. I still get self-conscious when there are other people around. Particularly the coaches. It's tough to be an adult beginner. It's better than being an adult loser though. </div><h2 data-label="866147" class="ltx_title_subsection">August 6, 2019</h2><div>I had another good paddle this morning. Bloody hell it's hard though. I had a couple of moments of really feeling like I was doing it</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
