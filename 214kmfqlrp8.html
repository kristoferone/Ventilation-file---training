<div>I'm going to use my cycling as a way of developing my baseline fitness. I'm still pretty good on a bike and I know how to use it to train. It won't be an end in itself though. </div><h2 data-label="443335" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 30, 2019</h2><div>Sick and tired. Maybe slightly overtrained. Overtrained is not quite the right word, it's actually overstressed. I still got out for a nearly two kilometre paddle this morning. I saw a guy coming down and hop into his canoe and paddle off down the river looking very calm, steady, and sure of himself. That's kind of my dream, my vision. First thing in the morning, quiet calm river, paddling off smoothly and powerfully. Sure of myself. </div><div>I'll get there.  Well I'll probably never really be sure of myself. I might appear that way though. </div><div>Onwards!</div><div>Now, for example if I were to take my list of exercises that I made yesterday and broke it into two, Day 1 and Day 2. I could do each twice a week. I could use a timer and do a set every minute for ten minutes each exercise. </div><div>Day 1:</div><ul><li>Pull ups x 2</li><li>Push ups </li><li>Foot presses</li><li>Bicycles</li></ul><div>Day 2:</div><ul><li>Roll outs</li><li>Leg lifts</li><li>Supermans</li><li>Crunches</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
