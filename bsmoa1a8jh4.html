<div>This morning I did my endurance core workout. I still think it's really good. There's also the possibility of swapping in some similar exercises. For example, today I did bird dogs instead of supermans. I could do crunches on the stability ball instead of the floor. Same with back extensions. What else? Get creative! </div><div>I also did a pretty good pull-up workout. I did eccentric pull-ups (negative) which are the weirdest feeling. Really kind of frustrating! Then my normal pull-ups, alternating hands in/hands out, then weighted pull-ups with a medicine ball between my knees also alternating hands in/hands out.</div><div>I'm still doing meditation and stretching every morning. I'm more convinced than ever how important they are. </div><div>The next stage of my endurance core training is 7 minute intervals. Should be very entertaining!</div><div>Alright tomorrow! Strength! My goal is to get up early again. </div><ul><li>12 minute meditation</li><li>All three DC workouts 74 minutes</li><li>Stretching 19 minutes</li></ul><div>Total: 1 hour and 45 minutes</div><div>That means I'd have to start my workout fairly promptly at 5:00 AM. Ouch! I can do it though. That's going to be quite a hard workout day. Let's see how it goes.</div><div>I still want to return to dead-lifts at some point. I think they're a great exercise. I just need to go slowly and focus on form first and weight after. It's true that I'm pretty strong. But my back has twinged a couple of times. So I need to go slow to go fast. </div><div>On that topic, I may have exercises to do tomorrow that are a challenge for my lower back. Don't risk it! Do the easier variation, do an alternative, or just stop and don't do anything. Especially with leg lifts, be very careful. I don't want another back injury again. OK, so a very good alternative is to do the wall sit and hip flex or whatever it's called from Tom Danielson's book. Don't do anything that risks your lower back again.</div><div>I've got a super-nice workout to do on the bike on Thursday. Short, hard intervals with lots of recovery. I think I should try and do some extra to get this week back on track. Maybe Thursday will be a bike only day? OK, I've scheduled some extra bike time this week. Let's see how it goes.</div><div>I'm not totally sure how much cycling to do or how to fit in into my routine. </div><h2 data-label="863365" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 18, 2019</h2><div>Not very convincing workout this morning. I did the DC full and lower body workouts. There's some good ideas in it for sure. I just don't think they're hard enough workouts. I need to do some good hard strength training and muscle building during those workouts. The variety in DC workouts is good and I think they're a good supplement to other things.</div><div>Canoe is really hard so training has to be pretty hard as well. If I look at the physique of many canoers, compared to mine, they have big shoulders, big chest, big back, and big bum. If I want to look like a canoer (which I very much do), I need to focus on developing strength and fitness and endurance, but also a physique that's suitable and capable for the sport. I also want to keep leaning down as much as I can. </div><div>I was really not convinced that my workout this morning was the best use of my time. </div><div>The stretching on the other hand feels really good and really beneficial for me. </div><div>I'm going to lower the weight on the bar and start doing some dead-lifts again. Slow and easy. Don't over-stress anything.&nbsp;</div><div>Tomorrow is another core day. I'm going to swap a couple of exercises to keep things interesting. I'm going to do crunches, oblique crunches, bird-dogs, and hip bridge, well basically, from my back,&nbsp; lifting my hips into a bridge position then lowering. repeat. We'll see how that goes. I am going to try and turn on my watch and track my effort throughout the workout. I would like to be doing workouts that burn about </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
