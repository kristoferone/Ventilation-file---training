<div>This morning I did my endurance core workout. I still think it's really good. There's also the possibility of swapping in some similar exercises. For example, today I did bird dogs instead of supermans. I could do crunches on the stability ball instead of the floor. Same with back extensions. What else? Get creative! </div><div>I also did a pretty good pull-up workout. I did eccentric pull-ups (negative) which are the weirdest feeling. Really kind of frustrating! Then my normal pull-ups, alternating hands in/hands out, then weighted pull-ups with a medicine ball between my knees also alternating hands in/hands out.</div><div>I'm still doing meditation and stretching every morning. I'm more convinced than ever how important they are. </div><div>The next stage of my endurance core training is 7 minute intervals. Should be very entertaining!</div><div>Alright tomorrow! Strength! My goal is to get up early again. </div><ul><li>12 minute meditation</li><li>All three DC workouts 74 minutes</li><li>Stretching 19 minutes</li></ul><div>Total: 1 hour and 45 minutes</div><div>That means I'd have to start my workout fairly promptly at 5:00 AM. Ouch! I can do it though. That's going to be quite a hard workout day. Let's see how it goes.</div><div>I still want to return to </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
