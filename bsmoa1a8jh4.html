<div>This morning I did my endurance core workout. I still think it's really good. There's also the possibility of swapping in some similar exercises. For example, today I did bird dogs instead of supermans. I could do crunches on the stability ball instead of the floor. Same with back extensions. What else? Get creative! </div><div>I also did a pretty good pull-up workout. I did eccentric pull-ups (negative) which are the weirdest feeling. Really kind of frustrating! Then my normal pull-ups, alternating hands in/hands out, then weighted pull-ups with a medicine ball between my knees also alternating hands in/hands out.</div><div>I'm still doing meditation and stretching every morning. I'm more convinced than ever how important they are. </div><div>The next stage of my endurance core training is 7 minute intervals. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
