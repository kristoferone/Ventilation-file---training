<div>This morning I did my endurance core workout. I still think it's really good. There's also the possibility of swapping in some similar exercises. For example, today I did bird dogs instead of supermans. I could do crunches on the stability ball instead of the floor. Same with back extensions. What else? Get creative! </div><div>I also did a pretty good pull-up workout. I did eccentric pull-ups (negative) which are the weirdest feeling.
