<div>This is a better representation of my body composition. It has the weight of muscle and of fat on the same scale as my whole body weight. My muscle and fat weights are calculated against the mean of the list of weights I've tracked. </div><div>My big news is that I started C1 erg last night at the canoe club. It was really hard but I did really well. I'm looking forward to doing a lot good training over the winter. I was surprisingly able to get through the workout. That's a testament to the good overall training I've done so far. I think it gives me some good ideas for how to refine my future training and go even further. Deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, kettlebells, etc. will all improve my specific strength needs for the erg. It's a lot more legs than one thinks.</div><div>I had a reasonably good workout this morning. I did meditation, an easy core routine, push-ups, roll-outs, and pull-ups. Nothing very taxing. Tomorrow will be much the same but with a few extra elements. I think I'll need to be out of bed at 5:00 in order to get everything I want done. </div><h2 data-label="566560" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 6, 2019</h2><div>I'm super stiff and sore from the C1 erg Monday night! :) I'm so happy&nbsp; that I signed up for it.

I've done 12 weeks of the last one and I'm feeling pretty fed up and stagnant. I want to be doing a lot more short, hard efforts. I think I have a sufficient foundation to move on to the next phase. So I'll plan about a month at a time. </div><div>Back to today, I didn't exactly rocket out of bed this morning. I did manage to do a reasonable workout. I did a very light core workout, followed by easy </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
