<div>This is a better representation of my body composition. It has the weight of muscle and of fat on the same scale as my whole body weight. My muscle and fat weights are calculated against the mean of the list of weights I've tracked. </div><div>My big news is that I started C1 erg last night at the canoe club. It was really hard but I did really well. I'm looking forward to doing a lot good training over the winter. I was surprisingly able to get through the workout. That's a testament to the good overall training I've done so far. I think it gives me some good ideas for how to refine my future training and go even further. Deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, kettlebells, etc. will all improve my specific strength needs for the erg. </div><div>I had a reasonably good workout this morning. I did median easy core routine, push-ups, roll-outs, and pull-ups. Nothing very taxing. Tomorro</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
