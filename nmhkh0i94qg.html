<div>This is a better representation of my body composition. It has the weight of muscle and of fat on the same scale as my whole body weight. My muscle and fat weights are calculated against the mean of the list of weights I've tracked. </div><div>My big news is that I started C1 erg last night at the canoe club. It was really hard but I did really well. I'm looking forward to doing a lot good training over the winter. I was surprisingly able to get through the workout. That's a testament to the good overall training I've done so far. I think it gives me some good ideas for how to refine my future training and go even further. Deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, kettlebells, etc. will all improve my specific strength needs for the erg. It's a lot more legs than one thinks.</div><div>I had a reasonably good workout this morning. I did meditation, an easy core routine, push-ups, roll-outs, and pull-ups. Nothing very taxing. Tomorrow will be much the same but with a few extra elements. I think I'll need to be out of bed at 5:00 in order to get everything I want done. </div><h2 data-label="566560" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 6, 2019</h2><div>I'm super stiff and sore from the C1 erg Monday night! :) I'm so happy&nbsp; that I signed up for it. Next year I want to do even more at the club. I'm going to arrive on the water in May in pretty good shape.&nbsp;</div><div>I made the decision to start another training program on the bike. I've done 12 weeks of the last one and I'm feeling pretty fed up and stagnant. I want to be doing a lot more short, hard efforts. I think I have a sufficient foundation to move on to the next phase. So I'll plan about a month at a time. </div><div>Back to today, I didn't exactly rocket out of bed this morning. I did manage to do a reasonable workout. Starting with meditation, I then did a very light core workout, followed by easy workouts from five apps: kettlebell swings, push-ups, squats, sit-ups, pull-ups. I, of course, substituted power cleans for squats and ab roll-outs for sit-ups. All pretty easy. All of those app workouts will progressively get harder at the same time that my core workouts will. I'll have to find ways to incorporate some recovery periods into my work or I'll be a bit of a fry-job. </div><div>Anyway, on to tomorrow. I only have one workout scheduled on the bike this week. And very easy workouts all around. I need to prepare myself for a hard week next week. I begin the second phase of my core training. I'm not sure about the role of other core such as stability ball, etc. I should probably keep going on the plan I started. Balance is so important as is core. The trick is enough time to do everything. There's never enough time. </div><div>I really hope the stand-in coach from this week will be the coach the whole time rather than Conrad. I'm not hard to motivate. Not at all. That's my wish for today.</div><div>Actually I have many wishes. </div><h2 data-label="763333" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 7, 2019</h2><div>No training this morning. No nothing. Either I forgot to set my alarm or it never went off. Got up late and just fooled around until it was time to get the family up. Oh well. This is a recovery week and it's good to get some R&amp;R. </div><div>I'll do some stretching and rollers tonight. </div><h2 data-label="947652" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 8, 2019</h2><div>I had a good, productive workout this </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
