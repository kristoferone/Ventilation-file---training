<div>I ordered a new stability ball to start working with. </div><div>On March 6, begin the 10-week stability ball program again with the goal of arriving at the beginning of paddling season with better balance and stability. (Hell, book your driving test at the same time).</div><div>Tomorrow, I have a one-hour ride. (I really like prepositional phrases, don't I?) I really hope that I can have figured out my trainer by then. My technical focus will be on keeping a smooth pedal stroke, particularly through the bottom of the stroke. </div><div>When I go skiing tonight, I'm going to just try and ski continuously and observe. I'm not going to try and&nbsp;<i>do</i> anything or in any special change anything. No, I'm just going to observe what I'm doing  as detailed as I can. I'm aiming to ski for about 30 minutes. That's my only workout for the day so I'm hoping it's got enough oomph.</div><div>I have two events this week that I have to have some strategies for. First, I have Indian food at the in-laws for dinner tonight. I don't want to over-eat or over-drink. I can use skiing as an excuse for both. More importantly, I have Mara's office Christmas party tomorrow. This is a challenging event for me as I'm not hugely comfortable in those sorts of situations. So my tendency is to drink too much. I don't want Kal to draw me into his usual insecurities and sleaziness. He's a very sweet guy and I like him a lot but he is insecure and I'm always ashamed of my behaviour when I'm around him. Perhaps, Peter will be there. I like Peter. I like Kal too. I just don't like the way he pulls both of us down. Don't leer at the girls on the dance floor. Find people to talk to. Talk to Megan. Talk to Sarah. Talk to Cindy. Talk to Nat even. </div><div>I also over-eat every year. I'm self-conscious about the way I'm dressed. Our night will probably no end the way Mara intimated a couple of weeks ago. The boys sleeping over is really the only way that's going to work. I wish Mara would go out with some friends soon. </div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
