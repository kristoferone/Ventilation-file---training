<div>I did a solid core and stability workout this morning. My same routine of exercises as always. Five minutes of each one. Always playing, exploring, and challenging. I'm prettyhapy with what I've arrived at for my core training. It's not perfect of course, but it's very good. One thing that I'm very happy about doing is the exercise where I focus on leg lifts. I have something funny in my lower back, a kind of clunking, that I think is an issue if I don't take care of it. So what I've done is to create the conditions where that clunking happens but concentrate very hard and work with small movements to make sure that it doesn't. The important thing is to really flatten out my lower back to the floor and keep it stable. So that's what I've been working on. My hope is strengthen that whole part of my back so that I can fix the issue, which I'm assuming is some kind of disk problem. I at least want to learn how to stabilize my back so I can do exercises without hurting myself. </div><div>I then did a very solid bike workout. It was a big ladder of zone 2, 3, 4 - five minutes of each. It's a challenging workout but I did it very well. I went hard enough to bump my FTP up again. I adjusted it, my weight, and my FTP heart rate in SPOK'D to better reflect what I'm currently doing. </div><div>Tomorrow, I've got a straight 15 minutes of zone 2. That's a great chance to just focus and work on relaxation. Smooth, fast circles. No edges or flat spots. </div><div>I've got another ski tomorrow evening. I'm going to mix things up a bit and do the circuit. Depending on how long it takes, I'll judge what to do next. If it's less than 30 minutes, I'll do it a second time. If more, I'll take the remaining time up to an hour on the track. I really want to become a good skier. I really want to be a good athlete. I'm doing all the right things; I just have to keep going. </div><div>I made the time to do a good stretch this morning as well. It's so important and really makes a big difference. For the first time in a long time, I skipped meditation. I just prioritized stretching over mental. I don't intend for that to be a trend though, mental work is the base, the foundation of my my plans. I think I could become a bit more sophisticated about my approach, but that's no big deal. </div><div>OK, quickly for tonight and tomorrow: strength tonight. Mara's going out so it's the perfect opportunity to do a bit. Push-ups, roll-outs, and pull-ups. </div><div>Tomorrow will be another core and bike workout. I'm going to try and get up with enough time to meditate and stretch. If only one, stretch. </div><div>Ski tomorrow night!</div><h2 data-label="462518" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 13, 2020</h2><div>I did a pretty strong strength workout last night and again this morning. I really hit the wall pretty quickly with push-ups. I'm a long way off of where I was a few years ago on the food truck. I can definitely improve a bit though. I was very pleased with the sensations I got while doing push-ups to failure. I think my body responded well to it. So what I'm going to do is not to back off to where I can complete the workouts well, but keep going so that I fail on every set. That way I can build some muscle. I want to push my percentage of muscle to 44 %. I'd definitely like to push my strength and muscle a bit and this is a good point to do it with about 2 months until the start of paddling season. Now, keep in mind, core and stability are hugely important as well. I just need to find a little extra time and energy to work on strength. </div><div>I'm going for a ski tonight! I'm going to go around the circuit at least once. I won't try and work on technique or anything. Just cover the ground and try to relax. Just enjoy being outside, feeling the cold air in my lungs and being alive. </div><div>I wonder if I should change how I do meditation. It's a bit time-consuming as I'm doing it and I'm not totally sure that HeadSpace is the best approach. Though I could say that things are largely moving in the right direction. I don't know much of that I can attribute to HS. I should probably keep at it. </div><div>I have more time in the morning than I use at the moment. I still have many dead spots that I could use to do a little more. </div><div>I've got a super hard workout on the bike tomorrow morning. It's going to take a lot of concentration to keep my power on for the whole time. I'm going to try and do strength and stretching as well. All together I'll need almost two hours for this workout so I need to get off to bed well. </div><h2 data-label="610108" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 15, 2020</h2><div>I decided not to bike this morning. I was running short on time and decided I would probably get interrupted or push my whole morning too late. I did lots of push-ups as well as roll-outs, pull-ups, and stretching. All in all not a bad workout at all. I'll move today's bike workout to tomorrow and tomorrow's to Sunday. </div><div>I had a very nice ski last night but I accidentally paused my watch so didn't record half of my ski. That's unfortunate for my Salomon Nordik Challenge. Nevertheless, my body did in fact record it. I'm still struggling quite a bit with my technique. Struggling is a strong and unkind term and not entirely accurate. I'm learning. I haven't perfected classic nordik skiing within a few short weeks, that's true. I'm sure I'm better than I was at the start of the season. My biggest insecurity has to do with that my trailing leg doesn't lift. All good classic skiers do that, I don't. So I'm insecure about it.</div><div>Alright, I've decided to give HeadSpace a rest and try out Sara Isakeva's recordings. I think her recordings will go for about a month so that will give me a chance to see if I like them. I'll save up the $70.00 or so dollars to buy her book if I like what I get out of it. I've paid for a year of HeadSpace so I'll still have it until October if I change my mind. </div><div>OK, I'm also not totally satisfied with how I'm doing push-ups. I've tried these ridiculous apps so many times and I always end up with the same complaints. It goes too high too quickly and seems to put the effort in the wrong place. For example, most of my sets this morning were too easy and then the last was way too hard. I think I can do a better program for myself without any trouble at all. Basically if I want to build some extra muscle, I need to do each set to failure with incomplete rest in between. So that's super easy: do push-ups until you can't do any more, take a small rest, do that again, and as many times as you can. It's really not hard. Well it is hard. It's not complicated though. I could do the same with pull-ups except I'm nervous about overstressing my elbow. I think I'll chill out for a bit longer. </div><div>OK, I'll try my new push-up program tomorrow and see how I do. </div><div>I've been very good about stretching this week. I think I've done almost every day. I hate to admit it, but it really does make a big difference. </div><div>Quickly for tomorrow: a hard bike workout. My legs feel good so I shouldn't have any trouble getting thorugh it. It's just a matter of concentration and relaxation. I'll try and do some push-ups as well. And of course stretching and meditation if I can find the time. </div><h2 data-label="646556" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 17, 2020</h2><div>Ugh! So much yummy, rich food this weekend! Definitely fell off the wagon. That's ok, I'm still on track for achieving my goals. </div><div>I had my first morning ski today. I'm going to start skiing a couple of mornings a week. It's not nearly as fun or pleasant as in the evening. It was actually pretty hard, dark, windy, and cold. Nevertheless, it's more time out on skis and that's what's important. I'm going to aim on doing the Gatineau Loppet next year. </div><div>For the next few weeks of my training, I'm going to focus a little more on strength. I'm roughly doubling the amount of skiing I'm doing and keeping the same amount of bike training. I definitely hope this will help melt some of the last bit of extra softness I have.&nbsp;</div><div>For strength, I'm still going to keep it very simple: push-ups, </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
