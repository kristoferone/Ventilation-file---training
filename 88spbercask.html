<div>I did a solid core and stability workout this morning. My same routine of exercises as always. Five minutes of each one. Always playing, exploring, and challenging. I'm prettyhapy with what I've arrived at for my core training. It's not perfect of course, but it's very good. One thing that I'm very happy about doing is the exercise where I focus on leg lifts. I have something funny in my lower back, a kind of clunking, that I think is an issue if I don't take care of it. So what I've done is to create the conditions where that clunking happens but concentrate very hard and work with small movements to make sure that it doesn't. The important thing is to really flatten out my lower back to the floor and keep it stable. So that's what I've been working on. My hope is strengthen that whole part of my back so that I can fix the issue, which I'm assuming is some kind of disk problem. I at least want to learn how to stabilize my back so I can do exercises without hurting myself. </div><div>I then did a very solid bike workout. It was a big ladder of zone 2, 3, 4 - five minutes of each. It's a challenging workout but I did it very well. I went hard enough to bump my FTP up again. I adjusted it, my weight, and my FTP heart rate in SPOK'D to better reflect what I'm currently doing. </div><div>Tomorrow, I've got a straight 15 minutes of zone 2. That's a great chance to just focus and work on relaxation. Smooth, fast circles. No edges or flat spots. </div><div>I've got another ski tomorrow evening. I'm going to mix things up a bit and do the circuit. Depending on how long it takes, I'll judge what to do next. If it's less than 30 minutes, I'll do it a second time. If more, I'll take the remaining time up to an hour on the track. I really want to become a good skier. I really want to be a good athlete. I'm doing all the right things; I just have to keep going. </div><div>I made the time to do a good stretch this morning as well. It's so important and really makes a big difference. For the first time in a long time, I skipped meditation. I just prioritized stretching over mental. I don't intend for that to be a trend though, mental work is the base, the foundation of my my plans. I think I could become a bit more sophisticated about my approach, but that's no big deal. </div><div>OK, quickly for tonight and tomorrow: strength tonight. Mara's going out so it's the perfect opportunity to do a bit. Push-ups, roll-outs, and pull-ups. </div><div>Tomorrow will be another core and bike workout. I'm going to try and get up with enough time to meditate and stretch.
