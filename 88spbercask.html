<div>I did a solid core and stability workout this morning. My same routine of exercises as always. Five minutes of each one. Always playing, exploring, and challenging. I'm prettyhapy with what I've arrived at for my core training. It's not perfect of course, but it's very good. One thing that I'm very happy about doing is the exercise where I focus on leg lifts. I have something funny in my lower back, a kind of clunking, that I think is an issue if I don't take care of it. So what I've done is to create the conditions where that clunking happens but concentrate very hard and work with small movements to make sure that it doesn't. The important thing is to really flatten out my lower back to the floor and keep it stable. So that's what I've been working on. My hope is strengthen that whole part of my back so that I can fix the issue, which I'm assuming is some kind of disk problem. I at least want to learn how to stabilize my back so I can do exercises without hurting myself. </div><div>I then did&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
