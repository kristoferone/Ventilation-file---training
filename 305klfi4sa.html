<h2 data-label="338477" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a fairly good workout this morning. I did my core workouts in full. That's the highest priority. I also did some push-ups and some pull-ups. I'm a bit tired today so I hit failure pretty quickly with both. I did manage 140 push-ups and 20 pull-ups. My weight is starting to edge down slightly. I am now, after nearly four weeks, back at the weight I started (187 lbs). I'm actually being slightly optimistic with that weight, but it's pretty close. That puts me at 12 lbs from my target which is very reasonable. I have an hour-long workout tomorrow morning. I still plan on doing my core workouts as well so I'll need a good night's sleep to get up nice and early to get on the bike. If I do my bike first, I'm more likely to get everything done. If I start with core, I may just space out until I run out of time. </div><h2 data-label="882456" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 26, 2019</h2><div>Well, I did my cycling workout this morning. I had trouble getting up in time to do more. That's ok. One of the really great things about spok'd is that they keep insisting that if you miss a workout, it's no big deal. It's also why I don't plan a lot of rest into my schedule. There will always be times when workouts don't get done. That's my rest. So today was a slightly light day and that's great. In all likelihood, I will get sick in the next couple of weeks. I'll miss more workouts then. That will be fine too. </div><div>So, what's going well with my training? I'm getting through my workouts well. I feel a bit stronger and leaner since I've been working on my core. My body feels better. My cadence is fast and smooth. I'm staying on top my power without any trouble. I'm starting to lose weight. I'm keeping a balanced approach with strength, core, and cycling. </div><div>What are my short-term goals (this week)? My first goal is always to complete all my planned workouts. Apart from that, I'd like to get some more sleep. I'd also like to do a bit more stretching. Stretching is just so boring! It's good for me though. I'll try and stretch and maybe do some rollers. The evening watching TV is really the time to do a bit of stretching. I'm just pretty tired by then. It's hard to get off my arse. </div><div>Long-term goals? To be in the best shape I can possibly get into for the start of canoeing season in May. I want to be ready to do a lot of canoeing this coming year. </div><h2 data-label="539264" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 27, 2019</h2><div>I had a very productive morning. I did my AA core workout, stability ball workout, push-ups,  pull-ups, and stretching. I did 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups. In all, it took about an hour and forty-five minutes for all of it. I'm not sure that training at the canoe club is going to work this winter. I'm not going to give up yet, but I have a feeling that it's going to be complicated. I'm confident that I can get in good shape without it. That being said, I was looking forward to being connected to the club to stay motivated and also to do some heavier lifting than I can do at home. Tomorrow morning I've got a quite long, ninety-minute bike. </div><h2 data-label="508513" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 30, 2019</h2><div>A successful weekend of training and a successful morning as well. I'm now moving into my fourth week of training. I've begun, ever so slightly, to lose weight. I'm getting through my bike workouts well. I need to do a couple of maintenance things: pump up my tires, pump up my stability ball (I might need to get a pin for that). I should also get my bike in for a tuneup sooner than later.&nbsp;</div><div>I haven't been using my watch to its full capabilities. It may help me to stay on top of my weight loss.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm going to have a slightly challenging workout tomorrow morning. Core and strength. My core workouts are not a big deal right now. I'm getting through my workouts just fine. My strength workouts have been more up and down. My goal is to hit about 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups. I had an idea about gradually ramping up the number of repetitions in each set. That didn't work as well as I had hoped. My overall volume went down. That's not the goal. The goal is the highest volume within a set amount of time, 30 minutes. I'm in a ligt</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
