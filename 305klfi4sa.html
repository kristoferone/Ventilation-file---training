<h2 data-label="338477" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a fairly good workout this morning. I did my core workouts in full. That's the highest priority. I also did some push-ups and some pull-ups. I'm a bit tired today so I hit failure pretty quickly with both. I did manage 140 push-ups and 20 pull-ups. My weight is starting to edge down slightly. I am now, after nearly four weeks, back at the weight I started (187 lbs). I'm actually being slightly optimistic with that weight, but it's pretty close. That puts me at 12 lbs from my target which is very reasonable. I have an hour-long workout tomorrow morning. I still plan on doing my core workouts as well so I'll need a good night's sleep to get up nice and early to get on the bike. If I do my bike first, I'm more likely to get everything done. If I start with core, I may just space out until I run out of time. </div><h2 data-label="882456" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 26, 2019</h2><div>Well, I did my cycling workout this morning. I had trouble getting up in time to do more. That's ok. One of the really great things about spok'd is that they keep insisting that if you miss a workout, it's no big deal. It's also why I don't plan a lot of rest into my schedule. There will always be times when workouts don't get done. That's my rest. So today was a slightly light day and that's great. In all likelihood, I will get sick in the next couple of weeks. I'll miss more workouts then. That will be fine too. </div><div>So, what's going well with my training?
