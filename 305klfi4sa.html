<h2 data-label="338477" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a fairly good workout this morning. I did my core workouts in full. That's the highest priority. I also did some push-ups and some pull-ups. I'm a bit tired today so I hit failure pretty quickly with both. I did manage 140 push-ups and 20 pull-ups. My weight is starting to edge down slightly. I am now, after nearly four weeks, back at the weight I started (187 lbs). I'm actually being slightly optimistic with that weight, but it's pretty close. That puts me at 12 lbs from my target which is very reasonable. I have an hour-long workout tomorrow morning. I still plan on doing my core workouts as well so I'll need a good night's sleep to get up nice and early to get on the bike. If I do my bike first, I'm more likely to get everything done. If I start with core, I may just space out until I run out of time. </div><h2 data-label="882456" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 26, 2019</h2><div>Well, I did my cycling workout this morning. I had trouble getting up in time to do more. That's ok. One of the really great things about spok'd is that they keep insisting that if you miss a workout, it's no big deal. It's also why I don't plan a lot of rest into my schedule. There will always be times when workouts don't get done. That's my rest. So today was a slightly light day and that's great. In all likelihood, I will get sick in the next couple of weeks. I'll miss more workouts then. That will be fine too. </div><div>So, what's going well with my training? I'm getting through my workouts well. I feel a bit stronger and leaner since I've been working on my core. My body feels better. My cadence is fast and smooth. I'm staying on top my power without any trouble. I'm starting to lose weight. I'm keeping a balanced approach with strength, core, and cycling. </div><div>What are my short-term goals (this week)? My first goal is always to complete all my planned workouts. Apart from that, I'd like to get some more sleep. I'd also like to do a bit more stretching. Stretching is just so boring! It's good for me though. I'll try and stretch and maybe do some rollers. The evening watching TV is really the time to do a bit of stretching. I'm just pretty tired by then. It's hard to get off my arse. </div><div>Long-term goals? To be in the best shape I can possibly get into for the start of canoeing season in May. I want to be ready to do a lot of canoeing this coming year. </div><h2 data-label="539264" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 27, 2019</h2><div>I had a very productive morning. I did my AA core workout, stability ball workout, push-ups,  pull-ups, and stretching. I did 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups. In all, it took about an hour and forty-five minutes for all of it. I'm not sure that training at the canoe club is going to work this winter. I'm not going to give up yet, but I have a feeling that it's going to be complicated. I'm confident that I can get in good shape without it. That being said, I was looking forward to being connected to the club to stay motivated and also to do some heavier lifting than I can do at home. Tomorrow morning I've got a quite long, ninety-minute bike. </div><h2 data-label="508513" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 30, 2019</h2><div>A successful weekend of training and a successful morning as well. I'm now moving into my fourth week of training. I've begun, ever so slightly, to lose weight. I'm getting through my bike workouts well. I need to do a couple of maintenance things: pump up my tires, pump up my stability ball (I might need to get a pin for that). I should also get my bike in for a tuneup sooner than later.&nbsp;</div><div>I haven't been using my watch to its full capabilities. It may help me to stay on top of my weight loss.&nbsp;</div><div>I'm going to have a slightly challenging workout tomorrow morning. Core and strength. My core workouts are not a big deal right now. I'm getting through my workouts just fine. My strength workouts have been more up and down. My goal is to hit about 300 push-ups and 50 pull-ups. I had an idea about gradually ramping up the number of repetitions in each set. That didn't work as well as I had hoped. My overall volume went down. That's not the goal. The goal is the highest volume within a set amount of time, 30 minutes. I'm in a light week of core workouts so I shouldn't have too much trouble doing 300/50 on each of my strength days (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday).&nbsp;</div><div>My legs are starting to look like cyclist's legs again and that makes me really happy. I've definitely got a good amount of training ahead of me so if my legs are looking in good shape already, then that's very encouraging for the future. </div><div>I have to be out of bed and ready to rock and roll at 5:00 tomorrow morning. I'll need to get off to bed at a reasonable time. </div><div>Now that I'm starting to move in the right direction, I can start to think more globally about where I want to be and how I'm going to get there. </div><div>Losing a small amount of weight makes me feel much more confident that I'm on the right path and that I don't need to start starving myself in order to reach my goals. My goal for my weight is still 175 lbs by the spring. </div><div>Looking back at my last week, I did pretty well. The only issues were when I drank too much or stayed up too late (or both). This Wednesday, if Mara is out at Zumba and drinking wine with Megan, and I very much hope she is, I still need to get to bed at a reasonable hour. It's going to be so very, very worth it. </div><h2 data-label="530235" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 1, 2019</h2><div>Not a great workout this morning. I was tired and couldn't get moving. I did my core workouts which is always the top priority. I didn't do any strength training. I might have had a bit too much wine last night. I don't know if that affected me very much. Mara was also quite on edge last night and I was consequently on edge as well. </div><div>Oh well, tomorrow is another day. </div><div>I want to prioritize strength tomorrow morning. That means I'll need to get up bright and early. I want to get through my core workouts plus 4 strength exercises: push-ups, pull-ups, dead-lifts, and ab roller. I want to do 20 minutes for each exercise for a total of an hour and 20. Together with my core workouts, that will be a total of about and hour and 45 - to close to two hours. A very good workout. That means I need to be out of bed and starting my workout at 5:00. </div><div>I'm still moving forward. That's important to keep in mind. </div><div>I want to pull some of my goals together toward a common purpose: a better me. My athletic, professional, financial, and personal goals are all intended at self-improvement. </div><h2 data-label="874325" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 2, 2019</h2><div>A much better workout this morning! I was having strange and disturbing dreams so it was easy for me to get up. </div><div>I did:</div><ul><li>AA core workout</li><li>Stability ball workout</li><li>Push-ups 200</li><li>Ab roll-outs 30</li><li>Pull-ups 50</li></ul><div>I could have done more push-ups but I was conscious of time and I wanted to also do roll-outs and pull-ups. I pretty much hit my limit on pull-ups so that's great. I had a very strange dizzy spell while doing ab roll-outs. I'll keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't keep happening. It was probably a combination of fatigue and holding my breath. Breathe! Remember to breathe!</div><div>My weight continues on an encouraging trend. Hopefully that will continue. I have three more workouts to do on the bike this week. </div><div>Pull-ups are great because they really do push me to my productive limit. And, unlike lifting heavy weights, it's practically impossible to hurt yourself doing them. </div><div>I need to keep canoeing at the front of my mind. All my training is for canoe. I want to be a super-strong solid paddler next season. Strong core, excellent balance and stability, great technique, strong as two men, and all around outstanding fitness and conditioning. </div><div>I should build regular testing into my cycling. Then I can re-calculate my fitness with updated and accurate numbers (FTP/weightkgs).&nbsp;</div><div>I have to keep watching C1 races and studying the technique and form of different athletes.</div><h2 data-label="836679" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 3, 2019</h2><h2 data-label="385027" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 4, 2019</h2><div>I did a quite successful workout this morning. AA core, stability core, roll-outs, push-ups, pull-ups. I didn't do a huge amount of any one of them but as a whole, it was an effective workout. I'm starting to feel differently in my body. </div><div>Now is not the time to be timid. It's time to focus and get even better at what I'm doing. </div><div>One thing that I'd like to try with pull-ups is doing ladders. In other words, doing sets of 4 until failure, sets of 3 until failure, etc.. </div><div>I did much better with my roll-outs as well. The trick (duh) is to stabilize your core before each repetition. </div><h2 data-label="799992" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 7, 2019</h2><div>Weird morning. I may have slept through my alarm or it might not have gone off. I'm not sure. Anyway, I only had time to do my AA core workout. I'll move today's bike workout to tomorrow and lose a day of strength training. Core every day though.</div><div>Keep up the good work.</div><div>I have a recovery week on the bike. My core recovery week was last week. Not ideal but it should be fine. I'm having second thoughts about training at the canoe club this winter. I think I can do good training on my own. I think the awkwardness of getting there is going to make me miss and avoid sessions then quit. I need to be careful about committing to things that I'm likely to fail in. I need to build on experiences of mastery and success. Cycling is great focus for me because it will allow me to push my physical condition very well. </div><div>I want to do a very good workout tomorrow morning. I have a 38 minute workout on the bike. If I'm up at 5:00 I can do my core workouts as well as some strength. If I had to prioritize one exercise for strength, I think it would be roll-outs.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="943239" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 8, 2019</h2><div>I had a reasonably good workout this morning. I did my AA core workout which is ever-so-slightly starting to get a bit difficult. I also moved onto the second phase of stability ball training. With a whole new set of exercises, it's quite challenging. I struggled with a couple of the exercises. </div><div>I'm looking forward to doing some strength training tomorrow morning. I need to be out of bed at 5:00 in order to do everything I want with the time I have. Core ~ 30 minutes, push-ups ~ 20 minutes, roll-outs ~ 20 minutes, pull-ups ~ 20 minutes. All together about 90 minutes of effort with transitions between, coffee, bathroom, etc.. I can use visualization to improve my abi</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
