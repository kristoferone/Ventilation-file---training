<div>So this is my core plan. I've also got my initial ball stability plan that coincides with the first phase. This is ambitious and difficult but definitely possible. The trick is always to stay on track when things don't go well. Stressed, tired, hurt, sick, overwhelmed, bored, discouraged. These things all happen. Things will go wrong. Things will get hard. Relationship problems, work problems, health problems, existential problems. These are all a reality. You have to be prepared for what will happen if things go off the rails. Sometimes you have to skip a week. Sometimes you hit a wall where you don't feel like you can go any further. </div><div></div>
