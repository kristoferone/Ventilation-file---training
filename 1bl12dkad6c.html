<div>So my next phase will begin in January. This is going to be really hard.</div><div>The only exercise I'm not convinced about is the leg-lifts. I don't think I need to over-strengthen my hip-flexors. Maybe there's an alternative. I'll try leg raises like in Chris Hoy's book. </div><h2 data-label="259099" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 18, 2019</h2><div>Quite tired today. I did one circuit of my core routine as well as a pretty challenging bike. I think I over-estimated my power levels because I'm not getting through my workouts well at all. I've dropped my FTP by 20 watts to try and get back on track. I don't like the new warm-up style in SPOK'D. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
