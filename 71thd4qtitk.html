<div>I made it through the full 70+ minute endurance core workout! I did it! The first circuit was in some ways worse than the second. I'm not sure I'm going to jump all the way to the 10 minute intervals. I think that step is going to be awful. I'd have to drop one exercise though. If I skip that step and go the next, it's sets rather than circuits and I'd need to do an extra exercise. Either back or obliques I would think. If I did my oblique side crunches, I could do one side for each set. That would work well.</div><div>Everything is going in the right direction. I'm getting leaner, stronger, better paddling technique, I'm becoming a happier driver. I've even endured through some sick and hurt periods and come back stronger. I'm going to continue working on the mental imagery/visualization part of my technical development. </div><div>I think my investment in core strength has been a good one. I see my strength as a whole improving even though I'm not doing a lot of weight training. </div><div>Tomorrow I have a half-and-half workout of core and bike. It's really key that I make time for stretching. I missed on it today. It's hard when my core routine is so long, over 70 minutes this morning. I wonder if I should try and keep my core workouts at 60 minutes. If I'm out of bed before 5:00 tomorrow morning I can do a full core workout <i>then</i> a bike workout. </div><ul><li>10 minutes meditation</li><li>30 minutes core</li><li>20 minutes stretch</li><li>30 minutes bike</li></ul><div>I'd need to start and work continuously from 4:45 through to waking up the family. That's not really realistic. If I get up at 5:00, do only 30 minutes of core then I probably have time to do some pull-ups as well. That's what I'll do. 30 minutes is 6 minutes of each exercise. </div><h2 data-label="969392" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 8, 2020</h2><div>I got through my workout fine this morning. My bike setup is a bit screwed up. The power readings were completely off. I still got through my workout OK and just made the best of it. Those are always hard </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
