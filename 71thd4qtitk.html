<div>I made it through the full 70+ minute endurance core workout! I did it! The first circuit was in some ways worse than the second. I'm not sure I'm going to jump all the way to the 10 minute intervals. I think that step is going to be awful. I'd have to drop one exercise though. If I skip that step and go the next, it's sets rather than circuits and I'd need to do an extra exercise. Either back or obliques I would think. If I did my oblique side crunches, I could do one side for each set. That would work well.</div><div>Everything is going in the right direction. I'm getting leaner, stronger, better paddling technique, I'm becoming a happier driver. I've even endured through some sick and hurt periods and come back stronger. I'm going to continue working on the mental imagery/visualization part of my technical development. </div><div>I think my investment in core strength has been a good one. I see my strength as a whole improving even though I'm not doing a lot of weight training. </div><div>Tomorrow I have a half-and-half workout </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
