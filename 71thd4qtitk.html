<div>I made it through the full 70+ minute endurance core workout! I did it! The first circuit was in some ways worse than the second. I'm not sure I'm going to jump all the way to the 10 minute intervals. I think that step is going to be awful. I'd have to drop one exercise though. If I skip that step and go the next, it's sets rather than circuits and I'd need to do an extra exercise. Either back or obliques I would think. </div><div>Everything is going in the right </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
