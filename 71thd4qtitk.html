<div>I made it through the full 70+ minute endurance core workout! I did it! The first circuit was in some ways worse than the second. I'm not sure I'm going to jump all the way to the 10 minute intervals. I think that step is going to be awful. I'd have to drop one exercise though. If I skip that step and go the next, it's sets rather than circuits and I'd need to do an extra exercise. Either back or obliques I would think. If I did my oblique side crunches, I could do one side for each set. That would work well.</div><div>Everything is going in the right direction. I'm getting leaner, stronger, better paddling technique, I'm becoming a happier driver. I've even endured through some sick and hurt periods and come back stronger. I'm going to continue working on the mental imagery/visualization part of my technical development. </div><div>I think my investment in core strength has been a good one. I see my strength as a whole improving even though I'm not doing a lot of weight training. </div><div>Tomorrow I have a half-and-half workout of core and bike. It's really key that I make time for stretching. I missed on it today. It's hard when my core routine is so long, over 70 minutes this morning. I wonder if I should try and keep my core workouts at 60 minutes. If I'm out of bed before 5:00 tomorrow morning I can do a full core workout <i>then</i> a bike workout. </div><ul><li>10 minutes meditation</li><li>30 minutes core</li><li>20 minutes stretch</li><li>30 minutes bike</li></ul><div>I'd need to start and work continuously from 4:45 through to waking up the family. That's not really realistic. If I get up at 5:00, do only 30 minutes of core then I probably have time to do some pull-ups as well. That's what I'll do. 30 minutes is 6 minutes of each exercise. </div><h2 data-label="969392" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 8, 2020</h2><div>I got through my workout fine this morning. My bike setup is a bit screwed up. The power readings were completely off. I still got through my workout OK and just made the best of it. Those are always hard moments for me. When things aren't going well with equipment. I'm very glad I didn't give up. Despite it all, my workout was still in the green! (just). </div><div>I also did my core endurance workout. One time through the circuit at 6 minutes each. It's definitely a challenging workout but not overwhelming. I actually think I can do quite a bit more. Which is lucky because there's plenty more to come! I'm wondering if I should do kind of a half-and-half of consistency and variety. The consistency is great but there's are many things that fall through the cracks. One issue is that I select core exercises that are easy enough for me to do up to 10 minutes of. Those might not be the best core exercises. I'm pretty happy with the ones I'm doing, but I know I could do more. So if I'm doing an hour of core, I could do the first half as the endurance routine and the second as a mix. Or, if I'm doing four core workouts a week, do the two full-hour workouts as endurance and the other two half-hour as variety. I need to make some decisions both in the short and long-term. I need to think about where my biggest benefits will come from. I still believe at this stage that core training, in myriad forms, is the best and most beneficial use of my limited training time. </div><div>Tomorrow morning I have a half bike, half - something workout. It could be strength. It could be core. </div><div>Now one thing I need to remember is that I haven't just stayed with the same exercises I started with for my endurance core workouts. As I've gotten stronger, I've changed things. Even just this week I've made modifications. Another benefit from adding some variety is that I might be able to put a bit of extra strain on my aerobic system and burn some extra calories. </div><div>You know what? What I'm doing is working. I have the data to prove it. I'm leaner, stronger, more muscular, better canoe technique than I've been in a long time. I have a harder time tracking my progress on how my cycling's progressing. I have the impression that it isn't progressing at all. </div><div>I'm on track to achieve my goal weight by the beginning of cycling season and by March I should have moved my body fat from the 'normal' category to the 'fitness' category. </div><div>OK, I'm having a slight epiphany about where I could go with my cycling over the next couple of years: gravel. It turns out there's a whole community of gravel racing and training here in Ottawa. I would need a gravel bike (which costs money) and time (which is equally hard to come by), particularly when my main sport is still going to be canoeing. </div><div>How does this look for a good year though:</div><ul><li>January - March/April skiing</li><li>April - May cycling</li><li>May - October canoe</li><li>October - December cycling</li></ul><div>That sounds brilliant. I'm going to adjust my training and put in some extra training time moving forward. The extra training will help contribute to my overall fitness as well as my weight loss. It takes a couple of years to build up momentum for things like this. I've already got a pretty solid base of training over the last year, and it will be so nice to have some sort of a goal to work towards. I'm actually feeling quite inspired about this. There are a couple of gravel routes that start within about 10 km of me, so that's actually quite doable. I could do a 25-30 km ride in the morning before everyone's out of bed. It's all about small efforts. Nothing huge. Maybe look at doing a race in 2021. </div><h2 data-label="388195" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 09, 2020</h2><div>A waste </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
