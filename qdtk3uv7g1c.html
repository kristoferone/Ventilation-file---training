<div>I was watching a video of criterium racing with fast corners and aggressive, shoulder-to-shoulder racing. It frightens me. I don't want to do that. I don't want to ever do that again. I like riding my bike. I love being fast and smooth on my bike. I just never want to race ever again. Well, definitely not criterium racing anyway. </div>
