<div>I had a pretty good ski last night as well. I did a full hour for the first time. I did almost eight and a half kilometres. That puts me just about on target for completing the Salomon Nordik challenge at just under 15 kilometres - a sixth of the way through. I'm also now into free skis! I can't remember just how many times I've been skiing but it's certainly more than 10. </div><div>True to my plan I stuck to double-poling and kick, double-poling. Admittedly, I tried a bit of diagonal stride and it was a frustrating disaster! I went back to double-poling. It was definitely a hard hour, but a good one. I was happy to be done by the end. An hour twice a week is definitely very reasonable. That way I'll be getting about 15 or maybe more kilometres a week. I think taking a course next year to fill in the basics of stride will be really helpful. For now I'll just stick with double-poling. </div><div>I'm going to buy a nylon brush for my skis. I should wax my skis again. I should actually wax them each time before I go out. </div><div>OK, tomorrow! I've got a pretty easy bike. It's an hour but not challenging at all. Sunday's even easier. I've got to stretch tomorrow and Sunday for sure. I need to release some of the muscle tightness I've got. My meditation has been a bit sketchy over the last few days and I'm looking forward to spending a bit more time on it over the weekend. And that's all the hard work for the week! Great work! You've been going really hard and you should feel really proud of yourself. Your biking, skiing, and canoeing are all going well because you're pushing really hard. There are no limits. </div><h2 data-label="655158" class="ltx_title_subsection">Week 5</h2><h2 data-label="655158" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 10, 2020</h2><div>Beginning of week 5! I've been training really hard and really well. I've already checked off most of my goals for this block of training. I should hit my goal weight of 83 kg within the next week. I've set a slightly more ambitious goal for my skiing than initially. I've committed to the Salomon Nordik Challenge, which is to ski 90 kilometres before March 16th. I did 18 kilometres this past week and I hope to do the same or even a little more this week. I'm really struggling with diagonal stride. I really don't get it yet. I find that really frustrating. I'm constantly torn about whether I should spend more time trying to develop my diagonal stride or just cut my losses and double-pole. I just watched a really good video that I think will help clear up a couple of things for me. The guy described the kick as the kick of a soccer ball, not a mule. He said it's not like pushing a scooter. I think that makes a lot of sense. So the compression of the camber is to drive the opposite leg forward. So, I shouldn't worry at all about the trailing leg. The most important thing is to work on shifting my weight entirely from one leg to the other. Then work on driving the opposite leg forward. I'm going to try that out tomorrow night! I'm going to do an hour. I'll start with no poles, then poles and stride, then double-pole, then finally kick-double-pole. 15 minutes of each? I want to get at least 7.5 kilometres in. That should be fine. Eventually I'll actually start to get better and be able to go further in the same time. </div><div>I think that my original goal of reaching 175 lbs or about 80 kg, is&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
