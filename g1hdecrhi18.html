<div>I had a pretty good ski last night as well. I did a full hour for the first time. I did almost eight and a half kilometres. That puts me just about on target for completing the Salomon Nordik challenge at just under 15 kilometres - a sixth of the way through. I'm also now into free skis! I can't remember just how many times I've been skiing but it's certainly more than 10. </div><div>True to my plan I stuck to double-poling and kick, double-poling. Admittedly, I tried a bit of diagonal stride and it was a frustrating disaster! I went back to double-poling. It was definitely a hard hour, but a good one. I was happy to be done by the end. An hour twice a week is definitely very reasonable. That way I'll be getting about 15 or maybe more kilometres a week. I think taking a course next year to fill in the basics of stride will be really helpful. For now I'll just stick with double-poling. </div><div>I'm going to buy a nylon brush for my skis. I should wax my skis again. I should actually wax them each time before I go out. </div><div>OK, tomorrow! I've got a pretty easy bike. It's an hour but not challenging at all. Sunday's even easier. I've got to stretch tomorrow and Sunday for sure. I need to release some of the muscle tightness I've got. My meditation has been a bit sketchy over the last few days and I'm looking forward to spending a bit more time on it over the weekend. And that's all the hard work for the week! Great work! You've been going really hard and you should feel really proud of yourself. Your biking, skiing, and canoeing are all going well because you're pushing really hard. There are no limits. </div><h2 data-label="655158" class="ltx_title_subsection">Week 5</h2><h2 data-label="655158" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 10, 2020</h2><div>Beginning of week 5! I've been training really hard and really well. I've already checked off most of my goals for this block of training. I should hit my goal weight of 83 kg within the next week. I've set a slightly more ambitious goal for my skiing than initially. I've committed to the Salomon Nordik Challenge, which is to ski 90 kilometres before March 16th.
