<div>I had a pretty good ski last night as well. I did a full hour for the first time. I did almost eight and a half kilometres. That puts me just about on target for completing the Salomon Nordik challenge at just under 15 kilometres - a sixth of the way through. I'm also now into free skis! I can't remember just how many times I've been skiing but it's certainly more than 10. </div><div>True to my plan I stuck to double-poling and kick, double-poling. Admittedly, I tried a bit of diagonal stride and it was a frustrating disaster! I went back to double-poling. It was definitely a hard hour, but a good one. I was happy to be done by the end. An hour twice a week is definitely very reasonable. That way I'll be getting about 15 or maybe more kilometres a week. I think taking a course next year to fill in the basics of stride will be really helpful. For now I'll just stick with double-poling. </div><div>I'm going to buy a nylon brush for my skis. I should wax my skis again. I should actually wax them each time before I go out. </div><div>OK, tomorrow! I've got a pretty easy bike. It's an hour but not challenging at all. Sunday's even easier. I've got to stretch tomorrow and Sunday for sure. I need to release some of the muscle tightness I've got. My meditation has been a bit sketchy over the last few days and I'm looking forward to spending a bit more time on it over the weekend. And that's all the hard work for the week! Great work!
