<div>For the last four days I've gone down 0.1 percent each day. That's a really good progression. Considering that I'm trying to lost 2% total for this block, that's only 20 days at this rate. Keep in mind that this rate won't continue this way for the whole time. I've got a pretty rich weekend coming with lots of family, friends, food, and booze! Just keep an eye on the ultimate goal. It's OK to relax a bit, just don't drink until the room spins or eat until your stomach hurts. I've actually dropped more than 2% over the last couple of months so another 2% drop is not unreasonable at all. I've dropped more than half a percent since starting this new block of training.&nbsp;</div><div>My mental work is going very well at the moment. It's a huge priority for this period of training. It's important, not only because it's a very powerful tool for improvement, but also because it's a slow process to get it really effective and difficult if not impossible to start once you're feeling stressed and really need it. Guitar is still a very effective place to reconnect with my visualization practice.</div><div>Visualization and ADM are related but not exactly the same thing. The main difference with ADM is that immediately after clarifying the movement in your mind through visualization, you carry it out and try to execute the movement exactly as you visualized it. Rather than trying to do a certain number of repetitions and sets, you break it down into 'movement forms' that you repeat through ADM to build habits. </div><div>Is it possible that I can fit in another short core workout this week? It is possible. Not likely though. I think most likely I'll need to look ahead to next week. What does next week look like for core? I'm going to add two minutes to each exercise for a total of five minutes each and 30 minutes for a circuit. Monday and Tuesday will be two circuits. Wednesday and Thusrday will be just one. </div><div>Sounds like a plan to me! </div><div>Think ahead to the week after when you'll be trying to recover. What will that look like for core? Just one circuit? Less time? Both? I'll think about it. I still have a hard week ahead.</div><div>But I'm nearly done two great weeks of training! You're working really hard and it's really showing.</div><div>Ski tonight! Get out there! Do it!</div><div>I have to put the glide wax on before I go. </div><div>Alright, I've made a 53 minute playmix! If I add a couple more songs to get it to an hour, I can use it for biking too. Or maybe I should make a separate biking playmix. For now I'll just use one. I've bumped it up to just over an hour. And, I've deleted a bunch of the songs and I'm back down to 54 minutes. Still plenty.</div><div>One thing I'm going to try and work on for my ski tonight is to do a double pole with a one-leg kick. I'll do one leg for a while then switch to the other. I'm going to do that to try and improve my leg motion. I'm definitely going to move to one of the other fields that's less crowded. I'll be less self-conscious then.</div><div>I always have to make sure I'm not getting dehydrated. That's a great way to get sick. </div><div>I can have one beer with dinner. I have more in the fridge for later. I won't need any tomorrow. After we get back from my parents, I'll probably be fully boozed up as usual. I shouldn't have any whisky as that puts me right to sleep and I'll really like to hang out and play my guitar for a bit while Mara's out.</div><div>Quickly, for tomorrow:</div><ul><li>Meditate - rehab pack</li><li>Bike - one hour</li><li>Stretch - if possible</li></ul><div>If I set the coffee maker and get up early I can do it.</div><h2 data-label="440255" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 24, 2020</h2><div>A very strong bike workout this morning. I raised my FTP again. Zwift makes it surprisingly hard to see your FTP. It's odd that they don't include that detail in&nbsp; your ride stats. SPOK'D hasn't adapted yet to my higher strength levels. I might be pushing a bit too hard on the bike but I feel really good and strong. I don't feel like I'm fighting the bike like I have been in the past. Fast and smooth like a track racer. I really think an FTP of 300 is within reach. I'm at 240 already. </div><div>I got out for another ski last night. I forgot to turn on my watch so I don't have any stats. I think I was out for about 45 minutes. I was going pretty well. I've definitely seen an improvement day after day of going out. I'll aim for twice more next week. I've been out 5 times in the last three weeks so that puts me halfway to my initial goal well ahead of schedule. Continuing at twice a week, I'll get in about 12 or maybe more skis by the end of the season. The pass was well worth it especially when I factor in the family skis. My technique is progressing slowly. It is progressing though. It will come. Just keep doing the right things and it will all pay off in time. I didn't have time to put wax on so I'll do that today. I'm going to make some time to study some more technique videos.</div><div>For the rest of this training week I just have a bike and push-ups to do tomorrow. Then I'll be done another successful training week! I'm very proud of myself and how hard I'm working at my training. I'm getting to a point where I can really push myself. I'm keeping a balanced approach and not doing anything extreme. I'm pushing hard but I'm prioritizing my health and safety. And the results are showing! </div><div>I should chill out a little bit on my ride tomorrow morning. I was definitely pushing a bit too hard during my zone 1 sections this morning. It's just great to feel strong. I'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend after having done all the hard work for the week. </div><div>I can start to look ahead to next week. Next week is going to be another step up in intensity. I anticipate avery hard erg workout on Monday that may be hard to recover from. It's going to be a hard training week and I expect to be tired and have trouble getting through the workouts. I need to rely use my mental work and the confidence I've built from this recent block of training to get through it all well. It's really important to remember that every workout you do is one fewer workouts you need to do. Just tick them off one by one by one until they're done and look forward to having a recovery week after that. Most importantly, look forward to the increased strength and fitness you'll have from working so hard. </div><div>I've been watching some videos of Olympic skiers. They're obviously super strong and monstrously fast. It makes me more optimistic that my technique is moving in the right direction. They make mistakes. They wobble. They slip. And that's at the highest level. They're obviously much, much faster than I will ever be, but I think I can learn to ski well. </div><div>This year is just the beginning. This is the year to get a taste for it and to start to solve some technical problems and develop&nbsp; my general fitness. </div><div>So here's the great thing: I've already achieved my cycling training goals for this block of training. Actually I've exceeded them by quite a bit. I was aiming for a 10% improvement and I've already got to more than 15%. Everything from here on out is gravy all the way to March 13 five weeks from now. </div><h2 data-label="659168" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 28, 2020</h2><div>The last couple of days have been very hard and I have struggled with both my training and the rest of my life. I've been feeling a bit sick. Not hugely but enough that I didn't train yesterday. Even worse is that I've had two really bad night's sleep. Last night I woke at 2:30 and couldn't get back to sleep. I finally got up at 4:00. By the time 5:00 rolled around I was too tired to do any workout and was feeling extremely on edge. I went back to bed and luckily got a bit&nbsp; of sleep so I'm not totally shattered now. </div><div>Emotionally I've kind of caved in in a bad way. I don't know how it quite happened. I ate and drank too much on Sunday and regretted it. That plus being a bit sick, plus staying home on Monday, plus missing a couple of workouts, plus worrying about money, plus nervousness about Mara (also to do with money) have all sent me into a nasty, little hole. </div><div>Time to get out though. You've only missed three workouts. That's not a big deal. You are a bit sick but not overly. Jamie was quite grumpy while he was feeling sick and I wonder if this is all part of the same. Money is definitely a stress, but you're making some positive changes and working in the right direction. </div><div>Yes, you slipped up with food and booze this Sunday. That's definitely not in line with your goals and not good for your health. Mara was also annoyed at me about it. It was just a mistake though. It was just a slip. Being home yesterday was hard. It reminded me of times when I've been dishonest and lying to everyone around me and times when I didn't have a lot going on. I've had a few of those times. Two years ago was one of the worst. Maybe the worst. A really horrible time. And the results of that period linger and still haunt me now. Money issues, relationship issues, body and health issues, confidence and self-esteem issue. There's only one thing to do and that's to move forward. </div><div>Yes, you've made mistakes. Small mistakes. Big mistakes. You just have to deal with it and move forward. Take responsibility, then take steps to try and not make the same mistakes again. Ah, there's a bit of the problem. I haven't taken responsibility with Mara. She would be totally impossible. I would very much like to live up to the image Mara has of me as the strong protector of the family. </div><div>I've been really moving in the right direction recently though. I just have to stick with it. It's really interesting that just recently over the last couple of weeks I was on a high with my training and everything was clicking. I was losing weight, hitting new power levels, getting though all my workouts really well and feeling great. At the time I warned myself that, like everything, there's a circularity to training with both the results and the feelings around it. When you're high you think you'll be high forever; when you're low then you think that's it. Neither are true. I've just crashed from a high phase to a low without anything in between. Sometime even a minor sickness can do that. I've also had a small injury with the stress on a tendon in my right elbow from doing pull-ups. That's also been a small blow to my confidence. </div><div>And work! Work! Ugh! This is a real stress. I don't know what I'm doing. That's another thing that's really impacting my life and my mood in a bad way. I feel quite stuck. </div><div>My stomach is still off but my psyche is feeling better. A bit less tight. I'll try and get out tonight for a ski. I'm going to bump my workouts forward this week so I don't have a full day off. I'm going to fall more on daily routine. Let's be honest, a 30 minute workout is not really a huge difficulty. </div><div>I'm really feeling tired. I should still get out for even just a few minutes of skiing tonight. I want to make sure that I have a good night's sleep tonight. That's so important. I may even stretch and meditate before bed to try and make sure that I can sleep the night through. I don't want any more bad nights. </div><div>I think it's really important to take note of these low phases. Take note of how you feel. What you think is going on. What you're preoccupied with. Right now I'm feeling a lot of fatigue from two bad nights. Last night and this morning I was extremely worried, agitated, and preoccupied with money worries. Money is worrying it's true. We're not in a great place right now. We don't have much of a safety net if something goes wrong. That's stressful. Mara is also slightly agitated right now. Not nearly as bad as last year, but there's still some tension there. I'm worried that she'll get intense and difficult again. </div><div>I'm going to really ease off of any drinking for a bit. I am perhaps a bit more fragile than I thought. </div><div>Part of me thought, and I still think a bit, that if I got a handle on exercise and training, everything else would kind of fall into place. </div><div>Now either I haven't got a handle on things yet or that isn't true. I'm not sure which. The times in my life when I have been very good at my training have been periods of enormous growth and development in other areas of my life. And in some ways that's true. I'm drinking less (generally), I'm eating better, I'm spending less money, and I'm doing a lot of driving. I still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm starting to get on the right path. At times I'm jealous of my brother that he seems to have so much more of his life together. I don't know. Maybe it's not as together as I think. </div><div>I'm a bit lonely. I wonder if Mara is too. I wonder if we've made too much space. She's too intense and I'm too withdrawn. I wonder what I can do to make things better without having to have a huge blowup. I can't handle that right now. Those sorts of events have never been good for us. </div><h2 data-label="549666" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 29, 2020</h2><div>Slowly getting back to myself, my routine, and my training. The past few days were an awful feeling. What a strange illness. I didn't do very much today. But I did sleep better and got up early. I meditated, did push-ups, stretching, and pull-ups. All in all a very light workout but a workout&nbsp; nonetheless. I'm feeling quite a bit better than I have for the last two days. Not quite back to normal yet. My stomach is still off and my mood and energy are still low. I'm bumping all my bike workouts forward for the rest of the week. Actually the workouts will pretty much stay the way they are except I'll do today's workout on Sunday. </div><div>Tomorrow morning I'll do a fairly light core workout: one circuit of three-minute exercises. I'll also do push-ups, pull-ups, and stretching as well as 30 minutes on the bike.&nbsp;</div><div>It's important to get a good night's sleep again. </div><div>This might be the moment to remember</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
