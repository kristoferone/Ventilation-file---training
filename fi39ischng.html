<div>For the last four days I've gone down 0.1 percent each day. That's a really good progression. Considering that I'm trying to lost 2% total for this block, that's only 20 days at this rate. Keep in mind that this rate won't continue this way for the whole time. I've got a pretty rich weekend coming with lots of family, friends, food, and booze! Just keep an eye on the ultimate goal. It's OK to relax a bit, just don't drink until the room spins or eat until your stomach hurts. I've actuallu dropped more than 2% over the last couple of months so another 2% drop is not unreasonable at all. I've dropped more than half a percent since starting this new block of training.&nbsp;</div><div>My mental work is going very well at the moment. It's a huge priority for this period of training. It's important not only because it's a very powerful tool for improvement, but also because it's a slow process to get it really effective and difficult if not impossible to start </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
