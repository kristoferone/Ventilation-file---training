<div>For the last four days I've gone down 0.1 percent each day. That's a really good progression. Considering that I'm trying to lost 2% total for this block, that's only 20 days at this rate. Keep in mind that this rate won't continue this way for the whole time. I've got a pretty rich weekend coming with lots of family, friends, food, and booze! Just keep an eye on the ultimate goal. It's OK to relax a bit, just don't drink until the room spins or eat until your stomach hurts. I've actually dropped more than 2% over the last couple of months so another 2% drop is not unreasonable at all. I've dropped more than half a percent since starting this new block of training.&nbsp;</div><div>My mental work is going very well at the moment. It's a huge priority for this period of training. It's important, not only because it's a very powerful tool for improvement, but also because it's a slow process to get it really effective and difficult if not impossible to start once you're feeling stressed and really need it. Guitar is still a very effective place to reconnect with my visualization practice.</div><div>Visualization and ADM are related but not exactly the same thing. The main difference with ADM is that immediately after clarifying the movement in your mind through visualization, you carry it out and try to execute the movement exactly as you visualized it. Rather than trying to do a certain number of repetitions and sets, you break it down into 'movement forms' that you repeat through ADM to build habits. </div><div>Is it possible that I can fit in another short core workout this week? It is possible. Not likely though. I think most likely I'll need to look ahead to next week. What does next week look like for core? I'm going to add two minutes to each exercise for a total of five minutes each and 30 minutes for a circuit. Monday and Tuesday will be two circuits. Wednesday and Thusrday will be just one. </div><div>Sounds like a plan to me! </div><div>Think ahead to the week after when you'll be trying to recover. What will that look like for core? Just one circuit? Less time? Both? I'll think about it. I still have a hard week ahead.</div><div>But I'm nearly done two great weeks of training! You're working really hard and it's really showing.</div><div>Ski tonight! Get out there! Do it!</div><div>I have to put the glide wax on before I go. </div><div>Alright, I've made a 53 minute playmix! If I add a couple more songs to get it to an hour, I can use it for biking too. Or maybe I should make a separate biking playmix. For now I'll just use one. I've bumped it up to just over an hour. And, I've deleted a bunch of the songs and I'm back down to 54 minutes. Still plenty.</div><div>One thing I'm going to try and work on for my ski tonight is to do a double pole with a one-leg kick. I'll do one leg for a while then switch to the other. I'm going to do that to try and improve my leg motion. I'm definitely going to move to one of the other fields that's less crowded. I'll be less self-conscious then.</div><div>I always have to make sure I'm not getting dehydrated. That's a great way to get sick. </div><div>I can have one beer with dinner. I have more in the fridge for later. I won't need any tomorrow. After we get back from my parents, I'll probably be fully boozed up as usual. I shouldn't have any whisky as that puts me right to sleep and I'll really like to hang out and play my guitar for a bit while Mara's out.</div><div>Quickly, for tomorrow:</div><ul><li>Meditate - rehab pack</li><li>Bike - one hour</li><li>Stretch - if possible</li></ul><div>If I set the coffee maker and get up early I can do it.</div><h2 data-label="440255" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 24, 2020</h2><div>A very strong bike workout this morning.
