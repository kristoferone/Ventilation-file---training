<div>For the last four days I've gone down 0.1 percent each day. That's a really good progression. Considering that I'm trying to lost 2% total for this block, that's only 20 days at this rate. Keep in mind that this rate won't continue this way for the whole time. I've got a pretty rich weekend coming with lots of family, friends, food, and booze! Just keep an eye on the ultimate goal. It's OK to relax a bit, just don't drink until the room spins or eat until your stomach hurts. I've actually dropped more than 2% over the last couple of months so another 2% drop is not unreasonable at all. I've dropped more than half a percent since starting this new block of training.&nbsp;</div><div>My mental work is going very well at the moment. It's a huge priority for this period of training. It's important, not only because it's a very powerful tool for improvement, but also because it's a slow process to get it really effective and difficult if not impossible to start once you're feeling stressed and really need it. Guitar is still a very effective place to reconnect with my visualization practice.</div><div>Visualization and ADM are related but not exactly the same thing. The main difference with ADM is that immediately after clarifying the movement in your mind through visualization, you carry it out and try to execute the movement exactly as you visualized it. Rather than trying to do a certain number of repetitions and sets, you break it down into 'movement forms' that you repeat through ADM to build habits. </div><div>Is it possible that I can fit in another short core workout this week? It is possible. Not likely though. I think most likely I'll need to look ahead to next week. What does next week look like for core? I'm going to add two minutes to each exercise for a total of five minutes each and 30 minutes for a circuit. Monday and Tuesday will be two circuits. Wednesday and Thusrday will be just one. </div><div>Sounds like a plan to me! </div><div>Think ahead to the week after when you'll be trying to recover. What will that look like for core? </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
