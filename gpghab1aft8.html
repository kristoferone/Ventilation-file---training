<div>This morning I did my meditation, day 1 of week 1 of push-ups. I did two circuits of 3 min core exercises on the stability ball which was pretty hard! I did my stretching then pull-ups. My right arm on the inside of my elbow is quite sore. I was improving for a while, but I think having a couple of days off has let the pain creep up a bit. All in all, it was a perfectly fine workout. I didn't go crazy with my core workouts as I wasn't sure how much it </div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
