<div>This morning I did my meditation, day 1 of week 1 of push-ups. I did two circuits of 3 min core exercises on the stability ball which was pretty hard! I did my stretching then pull-ups. My right arm on the inside of my elbow is quite sore. It was improving for a while, but I think having a couple of days off has let the pain creep up a bit. All in all, it was a perfectly fine workout. I didn't go crazy with my core workouts as I wasn't sure how much it would hurt and I want to be in good condition for a good, hard workout on the erg tonight. I'll aim to do a much harder core workout tomorrow. I'm also going to go for a quick ski tomorrow night. Remember that for your ski the primary goal is not exertion, it's laying the basis for technique. The intensity will come in time. Focus on the glide and weight transfer. </div><div>Again for tonight focus on hitting that perfect A shape every stroke. </div><div>So I have goals as listed in the diagram above. I have the activities that I've planned out to achieve those goals (core, erg, strength, ski, bike, etc.). I've prioritized my activities in order to achieve my goals. The one more thing is the strategies for going about it. Focusing on technique is a strategy. Aim-directed movement is a strategy. Another strategy is to use meditation and mindfulness to help with eating and weight loss. This is so important because it's so very easy to undo a whole </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
