<div>Let's try this for a bit and see if it works. I want to push my overall fitness so that I have the capacity to do the canoe training. My real training begins in May on the water. I just have to get there ready to rock and roll. I have quite a bit of confidence in my core training and that it's going to give me the base that I need for better performance in the future. Now that I've made those few modifications of course, mountain-climbers, bird-dogs, side bridges, hip bridges. Actually the only thing I've kept from the start is crunches, which are apparently not good for my back. I think they're fine though.</div><div>Tomorrow, more core and bike. Get some rest!</div><h2 data-label="929384" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 03, 2020</h2><div>I did it! 7-minute core intervals. It was challenging but definitely not out of this world hard. I only did one circuit and I was pretty happy to be done. Monday I'll try for two. I find the metronome really helps. I can kind of just space out in a concentrated way. </div><div>My back is still hurting quite a lot, but I think it's on the mend. I actually think I overdid it with the roller and that's why it's hurting more now. Yesterday evening it was really good. Luckily it doesn't really bother me during my workouts. I've got a full week to keep recovering before I hit the erg again.</div><div>I'll keep going with the 7-minute intervals for at least another week </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
