<div>Let's try this for a bit and see if it works. I want to push my overall fitness so that I have the capacity to do the canoe training. My real training begins in May on the water. I just have to get there ready to rock and roll. I have quite a bit of confidence in my core training and that it's going to give me the base that I need for better performance in the future. Now that I've made those few modifications of course: mountain-climbers, bird-dogs, side bridges, hip bridges. Actually the only thing I've kept from the start is crunches, which are apparently not good for my back. I think they're fine though.</div><div>Tomorrow, more core and bike. Get some rest!</div><h2 data-label="929384" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 03, 2020</h2><div>I did it! 7-minute core intervals. It was challenging but definitely not out-of-this-world hard. I only did one circuit and I was pretty happy to be done. Monday I'll try for two. I find the metronome really helps. I can kind of just space out in a concentrated way.&nbsp;</div><div>My back is still hurting quite a lot, but I think it's on the mend. I actually think I overdid it with the roller and that's why it's hurting more now. Yesterday evening it was really good. Luckily it doesn't really bother me during my workouts. I've got a full week to keep recovering before I hit the erg again.</div><div>I'll keep going with the 7-minute intervals for at least another week before progressing to 10-minute ones. At that point I have to drop from 5 to 4 exercises. Which should I keep? The hardest or the easiest? I feel I should maybe drop crunches and keep the others. Ouch.</div><div>I also did a bike workout this morning. I felt pretty strong and smooth. I think the core training I'm doing --- particularly strengthening my glutes --- is helping my pedal stroke. I overcooked the workout a wee bit, but that's good. It only means I'm feeling strong. One thing I wasn't able to do was to churn up big power in a big gear. That's something I'll be working on over the next while. I have two more chances this week. I'd like to hit over 600 watts consistently. Part of that is an optimum gear and slope combination. If you go in too hard a gear, the wheel slips when you try to accelerate; too easy and you're cooked before you can hit the big numbers. Today I only hit 474 watts for example. It was pretty shaky too. I tried to go out of the saddle which also didn't work very well. </div><div>Make more time for pull-ups. You're strong, you can do more. You can do proper workouts of pull-ups. If pull-ups are really the only form of strength training you're going to do, then go a little harder on them.</div><div>Chris Hoy recommended having a technical focus for every workout. I think that's a great idea. I have a bike workout tomorrow and I think my focus should be on the position of my lower back while I'm doing harder (Z4-5) intervals. </div><div>Tomorrow's a longer bike workout. It felt really good last week and I hope it will feel the same tomorrow. </div><div>That sort of brings me to the issue, issue's not the word, the problem of my meditation. I've been getting a bit all over the place with my meditation recently. I was doing really, really well doing the focus pack. I've started doing a few other packs recently. They're all good but I wonder if I'm doing too many at once. I should perhaps choose just one and stick with it. </div><h2 data-label="133676" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 06, 2020</h2><div>I didn't do as much today as I intended. It looks as though I may make it to erg practice tonight (which is awesome). And I have beer in the fridge for after! Woohoo!</div><div>Back to this morning. I did one circuit through my endurance core. I think I can manage two tomorrow. Conrad said this week will be a lot easier than last. Honestly it's always hard. So that will be a consideration for how much I'll be able to do. I'll aim for two.&nbsp;</div><div>Apart from the endurance core, I did meditation and stretching. I wonder if it's time for my meditation practice to develop to the next level. I also did a small amount of Alexander Technique today; a little bit of sitting and standing. Maybe tomorrow or the next day I'll put a timer on and do some timed work, two minutes of each for example. I think it's a really powerful skill and something that makes everything work better. </div><div>I'm thinking about going over to Mooney's Bay to ski a couple of times a week. Like Tuesday and Thursday. Then maybe plan a private lesson sometime in February. The trick is finding the right balance of responsibility and self-interest that training requires. If I'm going to get any kind of a ski, I'll need to leave at about 8:15. OK, we'll see. Canoe club for tonight is important though. </div><div>I was surprisingly tired doing my pull-up workout this morning. I definitely want to do more substantial pull-up strength workouts. That will mean I'll have to do more recovery of course. I did quite a lot on Saturday and I'm still feeling it quite a bit today. </div><h2 data-label="204900" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 7, 2020</h2><div>Another great erg session last night. I got Conrad to take a couple of videos and </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
