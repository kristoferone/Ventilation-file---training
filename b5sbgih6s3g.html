<div>I'm very, very proud of myself to have done this much skiing and to have completed this challenge. I really enjoyed my time skiing. </div><div>I probably only have a handful of skis left before the end of the season. I think I should only do morning skis if at all. I'd like to get out a couple more times. </div><div>Looking forward to next week and the start of a new block of training block. This will be a six-week block. The focus  will be to lead into the beginning of paddling season as well as to continue to build fitness on the bike. For paddling season there are four critical elements (these apply to some extent to cycling as well): core - strength, stability, endurance, strength and hypertrophy, flexibility, and mental training and visualization. </div><div>I'm not going to dilute my mornings with a lot of complication, I'm going to do either core or bike. No half and half workouts at the moment. Bike workouts will be one hour and core will range from 72 up to 84 minutes. This will be hard but imagine how you'll feel in May on the water. </div><div>I'm going to start lifting weights during the work day. For that I'll need a couple of things but I'll try and get started next week. Just 30 minute workouts.</div><div>I'm also going to go up to two erg sessions a week. It's going to be a tough six weeks, but I can do it!</div><div>It's really important to not try and do too many different things. Keep your tactics really concise as each strategically addresses your goal. What's your goal again? That's right, to qualify and compete at Nationals in C1. Past that to compete at two gravel cup races in the Fall, and even further to compete in the Gatineau Loppet next Winter. </div><div>The way this is </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
