<h2 data-label="992454" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 24, 2019</h2><div>I didn't go paddling today. I didn't ride my bike either. Or do any strength training. I was tired. I am tired. I felt surprisingly nervous while on the water yesterday. I was nervous to tip. That is, of course, ridiculous because I tip all the time. Something about being further from the club and the dock was making me anxious. Should I either stay closer to the dock until I feel a bit more confident or keep paddling down the river until I get over whatever anxiety is bothering me? Because of the anxiety, I was also extremely conservative in my paddling. I didn't want to tip and I was doing everything I could to avoid it rather than doing everything I could to paddle better. I'm still learning. I should probably still be tipping. I should be pushing myself to test my limits. Tomorrow, I'll stay within about a hundred metres of the dock and just work, tip, swim, repeat. I was also a bit nervous to go to the club while there's a group there. Again that's silly because I was with that group on Friday. There's obviously enough boats for everyone. I still have the feeling that I don't belong and that I'm an outsider to the club. As much as I detest the idea, I wonder if doing some volunteering would make me feel more connected and comfortable there. I should also just go quite often. Is four days a week too much? Probably not. Is it realistic? Again probably not. Three days is probably realistic. I'll aim to go Tuesday, Thursday–Friday this week and then the same next. I'll bike Wednesday, Saturday–Sunday. With strength in the evening. That makes sense to me. </div><div>I'm struggling with the feeling that I'm fat and ridiculous. I'm chubby for sure. Not fat though. I've been in this shape, and in worse shape, many times before and I know that I can get pretty sharp. I want to blame my age but I don't think that's actually true. Keep at it. Manage your stress. Manage your anxiety. Let go of&nbsp; the dream. Adopt a craftsmanship attitude. To get better at paddling I need frequent, low-stress time in a canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="895717" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a lovely paddle this morning. I decided to stay closer to the dock rather than go off down the river. I did increasingly big circles within about one hundred metres of the dock. I felt much more comfortable and I also tipped once. I should still be tipping fairly often. I'm still a beginner; beginners tip. If I'm not then I'm probably being too cautious. Not tipping is not a measure of becoming a better canoer. It just means that I'm better at not tipping. I need to be gently pushing myself and take cautious risks which means going over my limit every once in a while and tipping. That's the great thing about canoeing: the consequences of mistakes are practically nothing. The only slightly irritating thing was not knowing the time. That will be fixed after tomorrow though. I'll have a natty new Suunto watch to keep time by and I'll also be able to track my distance and effort so that I'll be able to see how and if I'm improving. Frequent, low-stress exposure to something that you find meaningful. That's how you improve at something. Of course there are many ways to improve at something, but this is a baseline, a beginning that I can then build upon. Obviously nobody becomes an expert at something in 15 minutes a day, but you can improve and be productive in that time. Then when time and energy permits you can do more. </div><div>To read, to write, to train, to meditate, to learn, to anything. It's important to have realistic expectations from what I can expect to achieve in such small amounts of time. I'll improve. From wherever I am, fifteen minutes a day is enough to improve. I won't get to some imaginary pinnacle of mastery and virtuosity with a chiselled physique and monumental intellectual prowess. No, but I'll improve. And if I keep at it, I'll improve quite a lot. </div><div>I'm really looking forward to getting my new watch. It was perhaps a slightly suspect and rash decision financially, but I really wanted it and I think that it will really help me with my paddling. </div><div>Mara said this morning that paddling was such a god thing for me. It's the best thing for me. It's being outside in nature, on the water, it's learning, improving, and mastering something new, it's technical and difficult. It makes so much sense, physiologically and emotionally and for every part of my history, interests and everything. This is why I want it so badly. I want very badly to get to a point where I feel like I am a canoer, a paddler. It will be difficult. In part I have to improve my paddling. In part I have to improve my confidence. Even at my best as a cyclist, and I was pretty g</div><div></div>
