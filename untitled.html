<h2 data-label="992454" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 24, 2019</h2><div>I didn't go paddling today. I didn't ride my bike either. Or do any strength training. I was tired. I am tired. I felt surprisingly nervous while on the water yesterday. I was nervous to tip. That is, of course, ridiculous because I tip all the time. Something about being further from the club and the dock was making me anxious. Should I either stay closer to the dock until I feel a bit more confident or keep paddling down the river until I get over whatever anxiety is bothering me? Because of the anxiety, I was also extremely conservative in my paddling. I didn't want to tip and I was doing everything I could to avoid it rather than doing everything I could to paddle better. I'm still learning. I should probably still be tipping. I should be pushing myself to test my limits. Tomorrow, I'll stay within about a hundred metres of the dock and just work, tip, swim, repeat. I was also a bit nervous to go to the club while there's a group there. Again that's silly because I was with that group on Friday. There's obviously enough boats for everyone. I still have the feeling that I don't belong and that I'm an outsider to the club. As much as I detest the idea, I wonder if doing some volunteering would make me feel more connected and comfortable there. I should also just go quite often. Is four days a week too much? Probably not. Is it realistic? Again probably not. Three days is probably realistic. I'll aim to go Tuesday, Thursday–Friday this week and then the same next. I'll bike Wednesday, Saturday–Sunday. With strength in the evening. That makes sense to me. </div><div>I'm struggling with the feeling that I'm fat and ridiculous. I'm chubby for sure. Not fat though. I've been in this shape, and in worse shape, many times before and I know that I can get pretty sharp. I want to blame my age but I don't think that's actually true. Keep at it. Manage your stress. Manage your anxiety. Let go of&nbsp; the dream. Adopt a craftsmanship attitude. To get better at paddling I need frequent, low-stress time in a canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="895717" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a lovely paddle this morning. I decided to stay closer to the dock rather than go off down the river. I did increasingly big circles within about one hundred metres of the dock. I felt much more comfortable and I also tipped once. I should still be tipping fairly often. I'm still a beginner; beginners tip. If I'm not then I'm probably being too cautious. Not tipping is not a measure of becoming a better canoer. It just means that I'm better at not tipping. I need to be gently pushing myself and take cautious risks which means going over my limit every once in a while and tipping. That's </div><div></div>
