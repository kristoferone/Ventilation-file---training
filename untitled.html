<div>I didn't go paddling today. I didn't ride my bike either. Or do any strength training. I was tired. I am tired. I felt surprisingly nervous out on the water yesterday. I was nervous to tip. That is, of course, ridiculous because I tip all the time. Something about being further from the club a</div>
