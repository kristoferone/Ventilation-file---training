<h2 data-label="992454" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 24, 2019</h2><div>I didn't go paddling today. I didn't ride my bike either. Or do any strength training. I was tired. I am tired. I felt surprisingly nervous while on the water yesterday. I was nervous to tip. That is, of course, ridiculous because I tip all the time. Something about being further from the club and the dock was making me anxious. Should I either stay closer to the dock until I feel a bit more confident or keep paddling down the river until I get over whatever anxiety is bothering me? Because of the anxiety, I was also extremely conservative in my paddling. I didn't want to tip and I was doing everything I could to avoid it rather than doing everything I could to paddle better. I'm still learning. I should probably still be tipping. I should be pushing myself to test my limits. Tomorrow, I'll stay within about a hundred metres of the dock and just work, tip, swim, repeat. I was also a bit nervous to go to the club while there's a group there. Again that's silly because I was with that group on Friday. There's obviously enough boats for everyone. I still have the feeling that I don't belong and that I'm an outsider to the club. As much as I detest the idea, I wonder if doing some volunteering would make me feel more connected and comfortable there. I should also just go quite often. Is four days a week too much? Probably not. Is it realistic? Again probably not. Three days is probably realistic. I'll aim to go Tuesday, Thursday–Friday this week and then the same next. I'll bike Wednesday, Saturday–Sunday. With strength in the evening. That makes sense to me. </div><div>I'm struggling with the feeling that I'm fat and ridiculous. I'm chubby for sure. Not fat though. I've been in this shape, and in worse shape, many times before and I know that I can get pretty sharp. I want to blame my age but I don't think that's actually true. Keep at it. Manage your stress. Manage your anxiety. Let go of&nbsp; the dream. Adopt a craftsmanship attitude. To get better at paddling I need frequent, low-stress time in a canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="895717" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 25, 2019</h2><div>I had a lovely paddle this morning. I decided to stay closer to the dock rather than go off down the river. I did increasingly big circles within about one hundred metres of the dock. I felt much more comfortable and I also tipped once. I should still be tipping fairly often. I'm still a beginner; beginners tip. If I'm not then I'm probably being too cautious. Not tipping is not a measure of becoming a better canoer. It just means that I'm getting better at not tipping. I need to be gently pushing myself and take cautious risks which means going over my limit every once in a while and tipping. That's the great thing about canoeing: the consequences of mistakes are practically nothing. The only slightly irritating thing was not knowing the time. That will be fixed after tomorrow though. I'll have a natty new Suunto watch to keep time by and I'll also be able to track my distance and effort so that I'll be able to see how and if I'm improving. Frequent, low-stress exposure to something that you find meaningful. That's how you improve at something. Of course there are many ways to improve at something, but this is a baseline, a beginning that I can then build upon. Obviously nobody becomes an expert at something in 15 minutes a day, but you can improve and be productive in that time. Then when time and energy permits you can do more. </div><div>To read, to write, to train, to meditate, to learn, to anything. It's important to have realistic expectations from what I can expect to achieve in such small amounts of time. I'll improve. From wherever I am, fifteen minutes a day is enough to improve. I won't get to some imaginary pinnacle of mastery and virtuosity with a chiselled physique and monumental intellectual prowess. No, but I'll improve. And if I keep at it, I'll improve quite a lot. </div><div>I'm really looking forward to getting my new watch. It was perhaps a slightly suspect and rash decision financially, but I really wanted it and I think that it will really help me with my paddling. </div><div>Mara said this morning that paddling was such a good thing for me. It's the best thing for me. It's being outside in nature, on the water, it's learning, improving, and mastering something new, it's technical and difficult. It makes so much sense, physiologically and emotionally and for every part of my history, interests and everything. This is why I want it so badly. I want very badly to get to a point where I feel like I am a canoer, a paddler. It will be difficult. In part I have to improve my paddling. In part I have to improve my confidence. Even at my best as a cyclist, and I was pretty good, I never completely allowed myself to think I was a racer. I wasn't on a trade team, I didn't race enough, I wasn't experienced enough. Those beliefs stuck me at a level of my development that hindered me. It's the mentality of "I'll be happy when everything's perfect, I'll be confident once everything's perfect." </div><h3 data-label="589620" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The Dominant Role of the Mind</h3><div>I return again and again to Aaron Shearer's ideas. I came to them a bit through Ricardo Iznaola, but nevertheless they  originate with Shearer. Simply put what&nbsp;<i>the dominant role of the mind</i> means is that your mind controls your body. Whatever is in your mind is what your body will inevitably do. And conversely, you can influence whatever you put into your mind is what your body will do. That's not exactly converse though is it? Oh well, in practice it means that you can improve and in fact determine your physical performance by working with your mind. </div><div>I can't find Shearer's reference to the dominant role of the mind at the moment. He published an article in Soundboard magazine after his method was published. The article was to clarify certain things that he felt had been misunderstood from his method. I have certainly made very good use of these principles in my guitar playing in the past, in my cycling and weight lifting as well. I can certainly use visualization and aim-directed movement to improve my paddling.</div><h2 data-label="674456" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 26, 2019</h2><div>Another good paddle this morning! That's three this week. I definitely have improved with each session. My idea of staying close and pushing myself a bit more is definitely the way to go. I'm much more relaxed and able to focus on my position and technique more. By the end of the summer, I would like to be able to go further. For now though, I'm happy with just doing a few hundred metres at a time. It also gives me a lot more practice with steering. A couple of things I learned this morning are that it work well to push off with my left leg on the paddle stroke. Then return to a straight upright with all weight back onto my right leg. I should have my new watch when I get home today. I hope Mara isn't upset or hostile about it. I'm really looking forward to it. The last two days, I've gotten out of the canoe to check the time on my phone about 15 metres from the dock. While the brief rest is in some ways welcome, it's not a good use of a small amount of time. When I went this morning, the novice canoe group was there. The coach, Liam, asked if I was joining in to which I said no. It was a complete non-issue. There were lots of canoes for everyone. So nothing to be uncomfortable about. I really love my time by myself at the club first thing in the morning. I have bike workouts for the next two mornings. So as my paddling goes up, my cycling has to go down a bit. Then into the fall as paddling slows down, I can bring the cycling back up, then transition to some skiing. I don't think I'll be skiing more than twice a week. I think it will still be good though. I think Mara should do more skiing. I think she needs a something. </div><h3 data-label="925890" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Mooney's Bay Skiing</h3><div>I'm going to sign Mara and me up for skiing classes at Mooney's Bay this winter. That will be a perfect Christmas present. Mara enjoys skiing and is actually quite good at it, particularly considering how little she's done. She'll need new waxless skis and for me to sign us up. We'll need to lean on A&amp;A a bit for babysitting. </div><h3 data-label="391184" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Back to July 26</h3><div>I'm most engaged with activities that have a physical element such as guitar playing, cycling, and canoeing. I also really enjoy the mental aspect of all those physical activities. I actually struggle somewhat with things that don't have some physical component. Maybe that's the trick. Both writing and speaking have a physicality to them. Typing does as well, but it's completely mechanical; not sensual at all. Time to be old-fashioned! I'm getting a bit off track now though.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="663501" class="ltx_title_subsection">July 29, 2019</h2><div>Got up early and tried to train but the body wasn't going for it. I'm getting better at figuring out when I need rest and when I can push. In this, routine is very useful. I begin every workout with a ten minute warm up where I begin at the easiest gear and gradually increase to the top of my zone 1. If I feel good but my legs are slow, I do some little rev-ups to 110 rpm or so to wake my legs up and get them moving. If I'm doing my warm up and my power isn't coming up as it usually does and I'm sweating heavily then I know that I'm tired and that I should rest. Do some stretching, do some foam roller, do some visualization. I shouldn't worry too much about getting through all my workouts. </div><div>I'm stressing a bit because I have more workouts scheduled than I can do this week. I'm also a bit sick. I'm also a bit anxious. All together, I have some things to manage. </div><div>Realistically I'm only going to do two bike workouts this week: Wednesday and Sunday. I plan to be on the water Tuesday through Friday. Three strength/core workouts. All in all about six hours of training. That's minimal but ok. An hour a day is a bit of a base. And because I'm spreading my efforts over three different activities, every workout needs to count. I'm not sure I have my strength/core workouts figured out yet. If been using a series of apps, but then I constantly have to override them. There's strength in routine. There's strength in repeatability. There's strength in mental practice, visualization, aim directed movement, and feedforward. </div><div>Feedforward is an interesting concept by I.A. Richards. As defined in the OED:</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>the use of calculated or presumed future states of a process to provide criteria for its adjustment or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control; anticipatory control</i></div><div>I  visualize best with guitar playing. Maybe it's the amount of experience I have or the amount of time I invested in learning how to visualize. Nevertheless, I have trouble getting the same  vividness with other activities. I still do get some degree of success everywhere, but it's just that: a matter of degree.&nbsp;</div><div>To be clear, the goal is that the intensity of the visualization actually produces a physical sensation.&nbsp;</div><div>Chris Hoy talks about his approach to managing stress and emotions with visualization. In effect, whenever he was feeling stressed or his emotions were getting away from him, he'd visualize the perfect kilo race. He'd constantly replace all negative images and emotions with a single, focused positive one.&nbsp;</div><div>What are some things I'd like to improve that I could work on with visualization?</div><div>Overall:</div><ul><li>Engage my TA</li><li>Lock shoulder blades</li><li>Release neck</li></ul><div>Bike:</div><ul><li>10 second, 30 second, 1 minute acceleration</li><li>Cornering</li><li>Sprinting</li></ul><div>Strength:</div><ul><li>Pull ups</li><li>Push ups</li><li>Roll outs</li><li>Foot lifts</li><li>Crunchs</li><li>Supermans</li><li>Bicycles</li></ul><div>Canoe:</div><ul><li>Everything...</li><li>More specifically, reach, catch, pull, recover</li></ul><div>Ski:</div><ul><li>Basic movements</li></ul><div>There's a certain school of thought that suggests that, when done properly, the body can't distinguish between repetitions of something done physically and repetitions done mentally. I don't think that's entirely true; however, from the point of view of technique there is a lot of validity in this thinking. Physical conditioning requires physical stimulus. There's no substitute. Mental training can certainly <i>augment</i> physical training though. </div><div>Purple is the colour of speed.</div><div>I'm doing very well with my paddling. It's hard because it's hard. As Brian Kalson used to say "if it was easy everyone would do it." I have to keep in mind that, despite the frustrations and slow progress, I am moving towards something that's important to me. </div><div>I was watching a video of criterium racing with fast corners and aggressive, shoulder-to-shoulder racing. It scares me. I don't want to do that. I don't want to ever do that again. I like riding my bike. I love being fast and smooth</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
