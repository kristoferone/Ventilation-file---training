<div>I've added calories to my goals. If I burn through roughly 28,000 calories with exercise, I should be able to reach my goal weight. The weight loss is right on a very reasonable schedule of a pound a week. Minimally 600 calories a day should be adequate. </div><h2 data-label="492967" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 14, 2020</h2><div>I had a funny, kind of off morning this morning. I slept in a bit, in part, because Jamie and Freddie were up in the night. I could have got up at 3:30 but that's ridiculous. I tried a new ab/core program. It pointed out that I'm not as strong as I hoped in my core. I don't think I should change too much though. I've been making good progress with the program I'm on. I just need to find some opportunities to strengthen my weaker areas such as my lower core. I need to take a step back and really work with my ADM to improve my strength and capacity with my core without risking hurting my back. The same goes for all of my core work. Perfect form is more valuable than endless repetitions. I did my meditation, some core, and stretching. Not a wasted morning for sure. I think I'm suffering from some uncertainty that's making it difficult to commit entirely. </div><div>My stomach is still a bit weird, but getting better. I still lose some time in the morning in the bathroom.</div><div>My weight and body composition have been getting better and better. It's been a long, hard slog. It really started turning after I started doing erg sessions along with my endurance core. I'm going to be doing more time on the bike over the next few months so I hope that will have a positive effect as well. </div><div>I had a very good erg workout last night. I think I'm getting better and better each practice. The paddle stroke is much more dynamic than I realized. To get a fast stroke, you have to really explode. I got a "Good job." from Conrad which I didn't think was going to happen any time soon. I do work pretty hard and I listen and try to do my best to incorporate what he says. I'm going to keep working on the visualization. The great thing about the mental work is that it improves your form and technique. It also improves your awareness and ability to concentrate. Then you gather more information and that in turn improves the quality of the visualizations. It's a virtuous loop. </div><div>I noticed that my paddle, particularly the exit was a bit wild and uncontrolled. That will be something I'd like to control better. For now though, focus on good, consistent extension and moving the sled forward. I'm getting it. Every week is better.</div><div>I'm going for another ski tonight! Same as last week. I'll go at about 8:15 and ski until just before 9:00. I'll try and get 30 minutes. The focus is really on weight transfer and glide. You're not going to be going fast tonight. Just keep your focus. It's not going to be a huge calorie burner-either. I burned two days' worth yesterday! That's all fine. This is just the very beginning of building a base. Your job is to collect sensations that will inform your mental work and visualization. </div><div>Tomorrow is back to bike and core with push-ups and pull-ups as well. Not to mention meditation and stretching. Push-ups won't take long as I'm still right at the beginning. A nice thing is that I don't have to rush off to work, so I can put my stretching off until after Mara heads off to work. </div><div>Ok, for tomorrow:</div><ul><li>10 minute meditation - finding focus</li><li>push ups 11 minutes</li><li>core 1 circuit 6 minutes each 36 minutes</li><li>30 minute bike</li><li>10 minutes pull-ups</li><li>Stretching 20 minutes</li></ul><div>Doable. Totally do-able.</div><div>I really hope Mara goes out tomorrow night. I keep hoping...</div><div>Anyway back to the core workout, I'm going to try a couple of different things. First, most of the exercises will be on the ball. Well actually let me see:</div><ol><li>Bird-dogs on the ball</li><li>Side bridge on the ball</li><li>Mountain climbers on the mat</li><li>Hip bridges on the ball</li><li>Alternating oblique crunches on the ball</li><li>&nbsp;Hodge-podge on the mat - play, explore, try, just keep going for all six minutes</li></ol><div>Make yourself miserable. Don't save a lot to get through it all.</div><h2 data-label="917943" class="ltx_title_subsection"> January 15, 2020</h2><div>A good hard morning!
