<div>I've added calories to my goals. If I burn through roughly 28,000 calories with exercise, I should be able to reach my goal weight. The weight loss is right on a very reasonable schedule of a pound a week. Minimally 600 calories a day should be adequate. </div><h2 data-label="492967" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 14, 2020</h2><div>I had a funny, kind of off morning this morning. I slept in a bit, in part, because Jamie and Freddie were up in the night. I could have got up at 3:30 but that's ridiculous. I tried a new ab/core program. It pointed out that I'm not as strong as I hoped in my core. I don't think I should change too much though. I've been making good progress with the program I'm on. I just need to find some opportunities to strengthen my weaker areas such as my lower core. I need to take a step back and really work with my ADM to improve my strength and capacity with my core without risking hurting my back. The same goes for all of my core work. Perfect form is more valuable than endless repetitions. I did my meditation, some core, and stretching. Not a wasted morning for sure. I think I'm suffering from some uncertainty that's making it difficult to commit entirely. </div><div>My stomach is still a bit weird, but getting better. I still lose some time in the morning in the bathroom.</div><div>My weight and body composition have been getting better and better. It's been a long, hard slog. It really started turning after I started doing erg sessions along with my endurance core. I'm going to be doing more time on the bike over the next few months so I hope that will have a positive effect as well. </div><div>I had a very good erg workout last night. I think I'm getting better and better each practice. The paddle stroke is much more dynamic than I realized. To get a fast stroke, you have to really explode. I got a "Good job." from Conrad which I didn't think was going to happen any time soon. I do work pretty hard and I listen and try to do my best to incorporate what he says. I'm going to keep working on the visualization. The great thing about the mental work is that it improves your form and technique. It also improves your awareness and ability to concentrate. Then you gather more information and that in turn improves the quality of the visualizations. It's a virtuous loop. </div><div>I noticed that my paddle, particularly the exit was a bit wild and uncontrolled. That will be something I'd like to control better. For now though, focus on good, consistent extension and moving the sled forward. I'm getting it. Every week is better.</div><div>I'm going for another ski tonight! Same as last week. I'll go at about 8:15 and ski until just before 9:00. I'll try and get 30 minutes. The focus is really on weight transfer and glide. You're not going to be going fast tonight. Just keep your focus. It's not going to be a huge calorie burner-either. I burned two days' worth yesterday! That's all fine. This is just the very beginning of building a base. Your job is to collect sensations that will inform your mental work and visualization. </div><div>Tomorrow is back to bike and core with push-ups and pull-ups as well. Not to mention meditation and stretching. Push-ups won't take long as I'm still right at the beginning. A nice thing is that I don't have to rush off to work, so I can put my stretching off until after Mara heads off to work. </div><div>Ok, for tomorrow:</div><ul><li>10 minute meditation - finding focus</li><li>push ups 11 minutes</li><li>core 1 circuit 6 minutes each 36 minutes</li><li>30 minute bike</li><li>10 minutes pull-ups</li><li>Stretching 20 minutes</li></ul><div>Doable. Totally do-able.</div><div>I really hope Mara goes out tomorrow night. I keep hoping...</div><div>Anyway back to the core workout, I'm going to try a couple of different things. First, most of the exercises will be on the ball. Well actually let me see:</div><ol><li>Bird-dogs on the ball</li><li>Side bridge on the ball</li><li>Mountain climbers on the mat</li><li>Hip bridges on the ball</li><li>Alternating oblique crunches on the ball</li><li>&nbsp;Hodge-podge on the mat - play, explore, try, just keep going for all six minutes</li></ol><div>Make yourself miserable. Don't save a lot to get through it all.</div><h2 data-label="917943" class="ltx_title_subsection"> January 15, 2020</h2><div>A good hard morning! I did meditation, push-ups, endurance core, bike, pull-ups, and stretching.</div><div>OK, how am I doing towards my calories for this week? My goal is 3500.</div><div>744</div><div>153</div><div>140&nbsp;(estimate for morning core)</div><div>342</div><div>total: 1429 so far or about 40% of my goal.</div><div>It's not totally accurate because I'm not tracking everything. I think I'm slightly behind where I'd like to be. For the rest of my planned work this week, I'd guess probably 480, 500, 600. That's still a bit short. I think I need to a better job of tracking my activities.&nbsp;</div><div>OK, back to this morning. I a very good core workout. It was hard but pretty manageable. I'm very happily surprised at the progression I've been able to do with bird-dogs on the ball. It seemed impossible at first but I can actually do it. I really like my approach to core. I think it's going to do really well for me in the long run. </div><div>My bike was great this morning! I was super-strong and smooth. What an improvement! Having my trainer calibrated properly makes a big difference. Also, the visualization work I've done on my pedal stroke. Smooth circles. </div><div>Push-ups are still at the very beginning so still very easy. I've learned in the past that this app ramps up very quickly.</div><div>Pull-ups were stronger today than Monday as well.</div><div>So everything's going well! Watch your back! Don't do anything stupid.</div><div>AND, I went for another ski last night. I did some pretty good work. I'm still a complete beginner, but I can see an improvement from one week to the next. That's the only thing that matters, improvement day after day, week after week. </div><div>Visualization and mental work are still a top priority. </div><div>Another thing to note is that I've been doing very well at reducing my eating without being extreme or excessively proscriptive about anything. I'm working on the Headspace pack on mindful eating. I think it's really helpful. I  want to have indulgences. I  want to relax. I don't want to be overly vigilant about my eating. I also want to achieve my goals. There's a bit of give and take there. I think I'm going about it in a very healthy and balanced way. I can still eat whatever I want. Just a bit less and a bit less often. </div><div>Yeah, so smooth circles is the key. It's not about emphasizing one part of the stroke over others. It's small and smooth all the way around. Fast and continuous, not getting stuck muscling through the gear. </div><div>Alright, for tomorrow: It will be pretty much the same as today. I'll try and get up a little earlier to make sure I have time for everything. I'll have to run off to work at the usual time so I don't have the same flexibility as today. </div><ul><li>Meditation</li><li>Push-ups</li><li>Endurance core - same as today</li><li>Bike (a bit easier than today)</li><li>Pull-ups </li><li>Stretch (if time permits)</li></ul><div>If we don't go skiing as a family tonight, I'll go for a little bit on my own.</div><div>See ya tomorrow. You're doing great!</div><h2 data-label="497301" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 16, 2020</h2><div>This has been a very good week for training. I had a bit of slow start but I've more than made up for it and I can see big improvements. I've burned an extra, oh I'd guess 500 calories during active work since yesterday. That brings me to 1950-2000 for the week and I still have two one-hour rides to go. I may end up close to my goal. I think the weight loss is happening really well already so I don't have to stress about it. Lots of good training and mindful eating. </div><div>I'm very strong on the bike right now. My pedalling is smooth and fast, and my body position is relaxed and solid. Looking forward to laying down some big power  next year.&nbsp;</div><div>I went for another ski yesterday. That's two this week and three in the last two. It's absolutely lovely. I need to learn a tiny little bit about waxing. </div><div>A bit like I did with canoeing, I'm trying to get out for short lengths of time, frequently. I've been roughly dividing my sessions into three sections: ski without poles, ski with poles, double-poling. I don't have the perfect image in mind of ski technique yet. I'm going to keep working at it. </div><div>I did a good core workout this morning. It wasn't very long, but it was still effective. I'm very pleased about how I've been able to incoporate the stability ball into my endurance core routine. I almost can't believe how well my ball-bird-dogs are going. </div><div>The great thing about most of the exercises I'm doing is that there are all kinds of variations I can do of them as I get stronger. Actually some of the variations help to keep things going over the length of the interval. I'm going to try doing a shoulder bridge with alternating leg extensions. That's a super hard thing to do. Another thing I'm working on is a gradual progression to v-ups. I have to remember to be very careful with my lower back. </div><div>I'm also starting to make some progresss with pull-ups. It's been a hard slog, but it's finally working. Training is a really slow, almost glacial process most of the time. </div><div>&nbsp;Alright looking ahead to the next day or so. We're ordering pizza for dinner tonight. It's important that I stick to not over-eating. I'm going to get a little bit of beer on my way home as well. Not much just a little bit. I'm also going to try and stretch tonight. I may not. Tomorrow morning is a one-hour bike. It's a very reasonable workout of 4/ 2-minute zone 5 intervals and the rest is all zone 1. I'll try and chill out a little bit on the intensity. I have another hour-long workout to do on Saturday. So I can't be too cooked. I feel really good though. </div><div>It's important to stretch tomorrow and maybe do some roller work as well. I wonder how much of my newfound strength has to do with core work, how much with stretching, how much with visualization. It's interesting. I think all of it has definitely helped a huge amount. </div><div>You're doing amazingly! Huge changes in your strength and physique! Keep up the good work!</div><h2 data-label="349693" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 17, 2020</h2><div>This hard week is starting to catch up with me! I've bumped up my FTP in Zwift and my zones in SPOK'D. That means I'm going really well on the bike. I have one more hour-long workout to do tomorrow and I can cap off a great first week of my this period of training.</div><div>It's amazing that a single takeout pizza dinner with a couple of beers has a noticeable effect on my body composition and weight. </div><div>I felt still really strong on the bike. In fact, I think at the high end of my strength I'm almost as strong as I've ever been. It's mostly in the threshold and sub-threshold zones that my strength is not as good as it once was and definitely my endurance is lower. Who needs endurance though? I'm a puncheur! Power is where it's at. Once I've strengthened my lower back and core as well as improved my flexibility, I'll go back to more weight training. I can't afford any more layoffs from training because of back problems right now though. </div><div>On Monday I can recap on my progress over the first week. It's been a splendid week and I'm immensely proud of myself. </div><div>The week isn't done quite yet though. One more bike workout as well as managing to keep my eating reasonable. If I could get out for another ski that would amazing. I'm not going to hold my breath though. I'll try and do some stretching and meditation this weekend. Try to get a bit of sleep. Maybe sleep in a wee bit on Sunday? </div><div>It's great to enjoy these moments when things are clicking and there's visible progress. That's certainly not always the case though, is it? Sometimes things can stagnate or even regress for a long time. It's not unusual to feel discouraged and things will never change just as I feel like things are going well and will never change. There are natural ups and downs. Part of my strength on the bike this week is due to all the good things I've been working on; part is due to my easy training week last week. I can look back in these notes and see many weeks even months where my weight didn't budge and my training was completely stagnant. When things are low, remember they can go high again. When things are high, remember they'll inevitably go low again. As long as your still training it all moves forward. Yes, things will get low but there's an invisible floor that, barring injury, illness, or burnout, you won't sink below. This is also why it's so important to focus on technique and visualization as important drivers of training. They're less susceptible to the vagaries of the physical body that's constantly changing. </div><div>Let's have a quick look at some of my goals. </div><ul><li>Short term is until March 13 (Freddie's birthday) my goals are to improve my technique in all of my sports (cycling, canoeing, and skiing), the form-builder program on the bike, endurance core, weight and fat loss, 100 push-ups, 20 pull-ups, skiing at least 10 times (two done already), and all-around improved visualization and meditation. </li><li>Mid term is all canoe all the time. Try to race at Nationals this summer</li><li>Long term is start racing sprint canoe this year, start gravel racing next year, start ski racing the year after. </li></ul><div>An important thing to not is that I have already achieved my goal for improved power for this chunk of training. The first week is not even done and I've already achieved one of my goals.</div><div>OK, tomorrow. Get up nice and early. Not too late or too much booze tonight! Stretch, meditate, read a book. How about that? Crazy! It's very important to use the morning as efficiently as possible. It's not worth losing sleep and getting out of bed before 5:00 if you're just going to sit on the toilet staring at Instagram. The coffee maker was a major efficiency. Make sure you're making the most of t</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
