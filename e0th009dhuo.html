<div>I've added calories to my goals. If I burn through roughly 28,000 calories with exercise, I should be able to reach my goal weight. The weight loss is right on a very reasonable schedule of a pound a week. Minimally 600 calories a day should be adequate. </div><h2 data-label="492967" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 14, 2019</h2><div>I had a funny, kind of off morning this morning. I slept in a bit, in part, because Jamie and Freddie were up in the night. I could have got up at 3:30 but that's ridiculous. I tried a new ab/core program. It pointed out that I'm not as strong as I hoped in my core. I don't think I should change too much though. I've been making good progress with the program I'm on. I just need to find some opportunities to strengthen my weaker areas such as my lower core. I need to take a step back and really work with my ADM to improve my strength and capacity with my core without risking hurting my back. The same goes for all of my core work. Perfect form is more valuable than endless repetitions. I did my meditation, some core, and stretching. Not a wasted morning for sure. I think I'm suffering from some uncertainty that's making it difficult to commit entirely. </div><div>My stomach is still a bit weird, but gettbetter. </div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
