<div>That's an upward trend for sure. Maybe I need to think about my diet and make some changes there. Single servings only? No booze during the week? Sugar in my coffee? Eating out less? Better choices when we eat out? (pussy only? Haha) oh, don't be vulgar.&nbsp; </div><div>Anyway, back to what's working&nbsp; well at the moment, I've moved into my third week of my core and strength training plan. </div><h2 data-label="423294" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 17, 2019</h2><div>I had a productive morning of training with two core routines and two strength routines. I did week 3 of my AA core routine. The change from the previous weeks is that the number of repetitions goes down and the number of sets goes up for an overall higher volume. It's really not a very long or challenging routine so that's about perfect. I also did my stability ball routine, week 2. It's getting slightly more challenging but it's still very manageable. For strength, I did push-ups and pull-ups. I'm moving into a new phase for strength as well. Sets of push-ups have gone from 10 to 12 and I did a total of 240. Sets of pull-ups have gone from 2 to 3 and I did a total of 33. My workout tomorrow morning will be virtually the same as today. I hope I recover well between now and then. I think I might do pull-ups first then pull-ups. I might also reverse the whole order and do strength before core. On </div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
