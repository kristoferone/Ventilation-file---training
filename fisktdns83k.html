<div>That's an upward trend for sure. Maybe I need to think about my diet and make some changes there. Single servings only? No booze during the week? Sugar in my coffee? Eating out less? Better choices when we eat out? (pussy only? Haha) oh, don't be vulgar.&nbsp; </div><div>Anyway, back to what's working&nbsp; well at the moment, I've moved into my third week of my core and strength training plan. </div><h2 data-label="423294" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 17, 2019</h2><div>I had a productive morning of training with two core routines and two strength routines. I did week 3 of my AA core routine. The change from the previous weeks is that the number of repetitions goes down and the number of sets goes up for an overall higher volume. It's really not a very long or challenging routine so that's about perfect. I also did my stability ball routine, week 2. It's getting slightly more challenging but it's still very manageable. For strength, I did push-ups and pull-ups. I'm moving into a new phase for strength as well. Sets of push-ups have gone from 10 to 12 and I did a total of 240. Sets of pull-ups have gone from 2 to 3 and I did a total of 21. My workout tomorrow morning will be virtually the same as today. I hope I recover well between now and then. I think I might do pull-ups first then pull-ups. I might also reverse the whole order and do strength before core. During the week, on the days I have a bike workout to do, I won't do strength workouts but I will do core. On the weekend I'll just do bike. So Sunday will be a light day. </div><div> I was hoping to have lost a pound and a half by now but I have in fact gained about twice that. </div><h2 data-label="109338" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 18, 2019</h2><div>Another successful morning. I've been able to rack up some pretty good accomplishments so far. I have some very good qualities for my training. Focus and concentration is a good one (though I do distract myself), my ability to play through movements in my mind and refine them in my imagination is a very powerful skill. It's a skill that I've cultivated over many years and one that I can develop even further. It's perhaps unreasonable to find a chunk of dedicated time to spend on visualization exercises, and that might not actually be the best use of my time. The best opportunity is in the rest intervals. If I have a solid minute in between sets, I can use that time to mentally rehearse and focus for the next set. That's a really good idea. That will mean turning the computer off which is probably a good thing all around. </div><div>I changed the order in which I did things this morning with strength first then core. It works out to be about the same. I did more pull-ups but fewer push-ups and I got through my core workouts without any trouble. Tomorrow, I have an hour-long ride to do. Depending on how much sleep I get, that might mean I won't have a lot of extra time. I've already decided to not do strength on the days that I'm cycling. That will mean that I'm not doing strength tomorrow or the weekend but I will do it on Friday.&nbsp; </div><div>I have a pretty easy workout on the bike tomorrow. I just need to be up early enough. I'll be able to watch Top Boy and just relax. I'm feeling pretty smooth on the bike on the whole. My legs are pretty fast and smooth. Leg speed is one of the best indicators of a solid cyclist. </div><div>I'm thinking once again about buying some rollers for the winter. I'd like to work on my balance and proper riding position which is tough on a stationary trainer. </div><h2 data-label="450425" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 19, 2019</h2><div>A moderately successful morning. I did my bike workout just fine and did my AA core workout. I didn't do my stability ball workout though. I think I'm beginning to feel some fatigue. </div><div>I made a mistake though, I rushed this morning and didn't eat breakfast. I then got a goody at Bridgehead that completely offset the amoun</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
