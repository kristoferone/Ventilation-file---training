<div>That's an upward trend for sure. Maybe I need to think about my diet and make some changes there. Single servings only? No booze during the week? Sugar in my coffee? Eating out less? Better choices when we eat out? (pussy only? Haha) oh, don't be vulgar.&nbsp; </div><div>Anyway, back to what's working&nbsp; well at the moment, I've moved into my third week of my core and strength training plan. </div><h2 data-label="423294" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 17, 2019</h2><div>I had a productive morning of training with two core routines and two strength routines. I did week 3 of my AA core routine. The change from the previous weeks is that the number of repetitions goes down and the number of sets goes up for an overall higher volume. It's really not a very long or challenging routine so that's about perfect. I also did my stability ball routine, week 2. It's getting slightly more challenging but it's still very manageable. For strength, I did push-ups and pull-ups. I'm moving into a new phase for strength as well. Sets of push-ups have gone from 10 to 12 and I did a total of 240. Sets of pull-ups have gone from 2 to 3 and I did a total of 21. My workout tomorrow morning will be virtually the same as today. I hope I recover well between now and then. I think I might do pull-ups first then pull-ups. I might also reverse the whole order and do strength before core. During the week, on the days I have a bike workout to do, I won't do strength workouts but I will do core. On the weekend I'll just do bike. So Sunday will be a light day. </div><div> I was hoping to have lost a pound and a half by now but I have in fact gained about twice that. </div><h2 data-label="109338" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 18, 2019</h2><div>Another successful morning. I've been able to rack up some pretty good accomplishments so far. I have some very good qualities for my training. Focus and concentration is a good one (though I do distract myself), my ability to play through movements in my mind and refine them in my imagination is a very powerful skill. It's a skill that I've cultivated over many years and one that I can develop even further. It's perhaps unreasonable to find a chunk of dedicated time to spend on visualization exercises, and that might not actually be the best use of my time. The best opportunity is in the rest intervals. If I have a solid minute in between sets, I can use that time to mentally rehearse and focus for the next set. That's a really good idea. That will mean turning the computer off which is probably a good thing all around. </div><div>I changed the order in which I did things this morning with strength first then core. It works out to be about the same. I did more pull-ups but fewer push-ups and I got through my core workouts without any trouble. Tomorrow, I have an hour-long ride to do. Depending on how much sleep I get, that might mean I won't have a lot of extra time. I've already decided to not do strength on the days that I'm cycling. That will mean that I'm not doing strength tomorrow or the weekend but I will do it on Friday.&nbsp; </div><div>I have a pretty easy workout on the bike tomorrow. I just need to be up early enough. I'll be able to watch Top Boy and just relax. I'm feeling pretty smooth on the bike on the whole. My legs are pretty fast and smooth. Leg speed is one of the best indicators of a solid cyclist. </div><div>I'm thinking once again about buying some rollers for the winter. I'd like to work on my balance and proper riding position which is tough on a stationary trainer. </div><h2 data-label="450425" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 19, 2019</h2><div>A moderately successful morning. I did my bike workout just fine and did my AA core workout. I didn't do my stability ball workout though. I think I'm beginning to feel some fatigue. </div><div>I made a mistake though, I rushed this morning and didn't eat breakfast. I then got a goody at Bridgehead that completely offset the amount of calories that I burned during my workout. It really is that easy, an hour on the bike equals a tiny treat that's gone in moment. I had a very healthy lunch but when I'm trying to actively lose weight, every little bit counts. I don't want to become obsessive or neurotic about it but I do want to see some results. I have seen some results though, my hips are getting smaller. I nearly went to the next hole on my belt this morning. A year ago, I was on the last hole. Very soon I'll be on the third. Weight is tricky. It's not always a great indicator of body composition. Still, I want to get down to my target weight. </div><div>Mental fatigue is an issue that all athletes face. Yes, I'm probably physically tired as well, but it's the mental side that is more difficult. There's a couple of things that really help with the mental side and motivation. Planning is definitely the best way to keep on track. Confusion and indecision are very taxing mentally. Making decisions is generally a cost on your mental and cognitive resources. That's why we should make decisions ahead of time as much as possible. As Shearer says, avoid the enemies of concentration: anxiety, confusion, boredom, and discomfort. Some discomfort is inherent to exercise and actually the point of it, but there's a distinction between your lungs and legs burning discomfort and your crotch chaffing. One is productive, the other not. Feed-forward, or projecting oneself into the future to a desirable outcome or state is also important. We always have explicit and implicit goals in our behaviour. Sometimes their ethereal and only appear in our minds transitorily. It's important to use visualization and imagery to sharpen those goals and make them more substantial. The more real that future image is for you, the easier it is to stay focused when you're feeling tired and frustrated.</div><div>Nevertheless, I am doing well with my training. One of the hardest things is to stay committed to the plan that you've created. It's easy to keep changing and end-gaining as you chase insubstantial and evaporating goals.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="863365" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 20, 2019</h2><div>I had the goal of doing 300 push-ups this morning and I achieved it! It took just about 30 minutes right on the nose. I also did my stability ball and AA core workouts. I have completed my third week of core and strength training. Tomorrow will be a challenging 90 minute ride. I'll need to get up nice and early to get that done without stress. On the bike by 5:15. I have to remember to be kind and patient with myself. I'm working hard and I'm working consistently and I'm making gains. My goals will come as long as I stay calm and keep with the plan I've made. There will be plenty of time for workouts to get harder. Do the work and the results will come. </div><div>I wonder sometimes why I'm writing so obsessively about exercise. It could be money. Or some work thing, or guitar playing. Or anything else in my life. Why so totally focused on training? Well first, exercise is what I'm doing at the moment. It's the thing that I engage with most in my free time. It's also completely safe. It causes me no anxiety at all. It's actually a huge relief and release of stress and anxiety to write about and plan my training. It makes me feel good. It reminds me that I'm good at something and that I'm progressing. It's something I feel that I have some control over. It's something to look forward to as well as to appreciate how far I've come. In other words, it's great! Keep writing about it.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="522169" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 23, 2019</h2><div>Very tired this morning. I had planned on doing my two core workouts as well as an hour on the bike. I did my AA</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
