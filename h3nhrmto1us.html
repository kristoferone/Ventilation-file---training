<div>I've raised my FTP once again. It's gone up to 270 w. That makes me really optimistic that I'll be able to push it to 300. Since the beginning of this current program I've pushed my FTP by 62 watts(!) That's a nearly 30% improvement. For context that's a bigger margin of improvement than the effect of EPO or steroi</div>
