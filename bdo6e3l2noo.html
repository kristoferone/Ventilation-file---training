<div>It's pretty stagnant. I think some enthusiastic strength training will help bump things in a better direction.</div><div>I'm going to move into the second phase of my core training as well. I think I've done enough adaptation work to be able to move forward to something a little harder. If I haven't moved into the next phase of cycling training at the end of this week, I'm going to change my plans and try to force a change. I'm not seeing any results from the training I'm doing right now. I don't feel like I'm getting any stronger or fitter, and as I can see from above, leaner either. I like a lot of things about SPOKD and I'd like to feel like it's successful for me and my training. I certainly haven't seen the results I'd like to yet. I think SPOKD is going to implement some benchmarking capabilities and that would be a big improvement. </div><div>The next block of training will be hard, but hopefully rewarding. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
