<h2 data-label="309159" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 20, 2019</h2><div>Good core workout this morning. I've refined my main endurance core to five exercises. So, I've broken my work into a couple of sections:</div><ul><li>Main endurance core - these are the exercises that I can repeat enough to stay on the plan I've decided on</li><li>Stability on the ball - I've taken just the stability exercises from the ball routine. I'm going to go about it a little differently. </li></ul><div></div><div></div><div></div>
