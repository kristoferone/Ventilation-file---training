<h2 data-label="309159" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 20, 2019</h2><div>Good core workout this morning. I've refined my main endurance core to five exercises. So, I've broken my work into a couple of sections:</div><ul><li>Main endurance core - these are the exercises that I can repeat enough to stay on the plan I've decided on.</li><li>Stability on the ball - I've taken just the stability exercises from the ball routine. I'm going to go about it a little differently. I'm going to do each exercise twice for 30 seconds. Then I'll gradually up the duration and repetitions and add more exercises. </li><li>Lower rectus abdominus - these are harder than the other core exercises so I won't be able to keep up the pace of my core program with them. So, I've broken out a series of four exercises that focus only on the lower abdominals. I've begun with one set of 30 seconds each and I'll gradually increase sets.</li><li>Nelo challenge - one minute of (is it called?) Russian twists with a ten-pound plate - pretty self-explanatory. Still stings by the end of a minute.</li></ul><div>All together this routine will take the following amount of time this week:</div><ul><li>Endurance - 22:55</li><li>Stability - 8:00</li><li>Lower core - 2:20</li><li>Nelo - 1:00</li></ul><div>Total <b>34:15</b></div><div>With a minute or so in between sections, it's probably close to 40:00. Hard, but definitely doable. That number will increase dramatically over the next few months. </div><div>I want&nbsp; to keep my cycling time down a bit. I'm only doing about two hours a week. I want to make sure I have enough strength-training time. I've been slacking on the strength a little bit recently. </div><div>Nothing I'm doing is nearly as hard as the erg though. </div><div>I've been doing quite well with my meditat</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
