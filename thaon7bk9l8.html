<div>I'll want to bring up my five-minute power. Anything longer than that, I don't care. That current 270 w power is at the top end of my zone 4 range. That tells me I could probably push it to 300 w in the near future. That's just over a 10% improvement. </div><div>OK, my job for tomorrow is to push my 5 m power to 300. </div><div>Tonight I'm going to ski for an hour. That should get me to 7.5 kilometres. So I'm very slightly behind my goal for this point but I should be able to make it up. I'm going to focus on double-poling. Kick double-pole, double-pole, and some sprints. You can't worry about what anyone around you might think. You're a beginner and it's OK to be a beginner. You're trying. I'm not going to do any legs-only or any diagonal stride tonight. Just variations on double-poling. </div><h2 data-label="477621" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 7, 2020</h2><div>Solid bike workout this morning! I exceeded my goal of bumping up my five-minute power: I pushed it up to 312 w, a 15% improvement! I also pushed my FTP up once again to 258 w. That's a 50 w improvement within this program, </div><div></div>
