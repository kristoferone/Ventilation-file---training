<div>It's very manageable. Each session will take about 20-30 minutes. I also have the apps I've been using which I'm not sure work all that well for me. I seem to level off at some point for each and not progress beyond that. I've never reached the promised 10 pull ups or 100 push ups or whatever. I had very good success with a simple formula in the past: a regular amount of work that can be repeated with regular rest intervals. It's about finding the sweet spot that you can keep going. That was the formula I used to reach 2000 push ups a day. I have four exercises that I've sort of tentatively been doing: push ups, pull ups, ab roll outs, and dead lifts. I coul do ten sets of each with a minute's rest in between, then gradually find my limit. </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
