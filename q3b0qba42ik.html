<div>It's very manageable. Each session will take about 20-30 minutes. I also have the apps I've been using which I'm not sure work all that well for me. I seem to level off at some point for each and not progress beyond that. I've never reached the promised 10 pull ups or 100 push ups or whatever. I had very good success with a simple formula in the past: a regular amount of work that can be repeated with regular rest intervals. It's about finding the sweet spot that you can keep going. That was the formula I used to reach 2000 push ups in a day. I have four exercises that I've sort of tentatively been doing: push ups, pull ups, ab roll outs, and dead lifts. I could do ten sets of each with a minute's rest in between, then gradually find my limit. Then it's about gradually getting stronger and adding more repetitions within that constrained framework. Those four exercises alone would make for more than 40 minutes of activity. </div><div>One thing I haven't been doing enough of is cycling. I don't know if I'll be able to make my weight loss goals without investing more time and energy on the bike. It's really hard to find the time and energy to do everything. My evenings should be for stretching, rollers, and recovery. Definitely drinking a bit less and sleeping a bit more will help. With the strength and core sessions, it's really important to keep track of what I've been doing and what my progress is. It's easy to get discouraged or just bored otherwise. The other piece to work on is balance. I have the core/balance ball program that I used to do. That might work well. I could also get a bosu ball and work on some exercises with that. The problem is scheduling and staying motivated. A good way to stay motivated is to focus on one thing for a set amount of time, then move on to the next thing. That's part of what's at the heart of periodization. </div><div>To achieve my weight loss goal of half a pound a week, I'll need to burn approximately 1750 </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
