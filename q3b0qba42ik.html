<div>It's very manageable. Each session will take about 20-30 minutes. I also have the apps I've been using which I'm not sure work all that well for me. I seem to level off at some point for each and not progress beyond that. I've never reached the promised 10 pull ups or 100 push ups or whatever. I had very good success with a simple formula in the past: a regular amount of work that can be repeated with regular rest intervals. It's about finding the sweet spot that you can keep going. That was the formula I used to reach 2000 push ups in a day. I have four exercises that I've sort of tentatively been doing: push ups, pull ups, ab roll outs, and dead lifts. I could do ten sets of each with a minute's rest in between, then gradually find my limit. Then it's about gradually getting stronger and adding more repetitions within that constrained framework. Those four exercises alone would make for more than 40 minutes of activity.&nbsp;</div><div>One thing I haven't been doing enough of is cycling. I don't know if I'll be able to make my weight loss goals without investing more time and energy on the bike. It's really hard to find the time and energy to do everything. My evenings should be for stretching, rollers, and recovery. Definitely drinking a bit less and sleeping a bit more will help. With the strength and core sessions, it's really important to keep track of what I've been doing and what my progress is. It's easy to get discouraged or just bored otherwise. The other piece to work on is balance. I have the core/balance ball program that I used to do. That might work well. I could also get a bosu ball and work on some exercises with that. The problem is scheduling and staying motivated. A good way to stay motivated is to focus on one thing for a set amount of time, then move on to the next thing. That's part of what's at the heart of periodization. </div><div>To achieve my weight loss goal of half a pound a week, I'll need to burn approximately 1750 calories a week (or about 6-7 pizza slices in Zwift). The last hour-long ride I did burned 443 calories, so that's about 4 hours a week on the bike to burn half a pound. If I put my availability as 30 minutes everyday and 1 hour twice a week, will that be enough? Of course the other training I do will also burn calories, raise my metabolism, and increase my muscle mass giving me a better body composition. Also, if I'm a bit more careful with what I eat that will help a lot. I eat a&nbsp;<u>lot</u>&nbsp; of naughty, rich food. </div><h2 data-label="825936" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 5, 2019</h2><div>I did a three-part workout this morning. Core, pull ups, then a recovery bike. I was happy to get through my core workout again without any trouble. I don't have any pain or fatigue from these workouts and that's a good thing. Plenty of time for pain soon! I'm taking a slightly different approach to my strength training. I'm going to delete the apps I have on my phone. They don't work for me. Instead, I'll return to my tested formula of regular intervals of work and rest repeated until positive failure. This will reduce the number of exercises I'll be able to do, but it will get a lot more out of those exercises. For example, this morning I did a total of 40 pull ups. I've never done that many in a single workout. I've never progressed beyond doing 15-16 using the app. That's a big improvement in terms of training volume and I'm a big believer in the importance of volume (with some qualifications of course). </div><div>Between the three workouts I did this morning I burned 369 calories, which is on track for 1750 calories a week for a goal weight loss of half a pound a week. Uncomfortably, since starting this weight loss plan I've gained weight! I was lighter after holidays of eating junk food all day. That's pretty typical though. My weight gain this week might be because of my indulgence last. It's never a straight line down. Your weight goes up then down then up again. What we're looking for is an overall trend downward over time. That will probably mean that some weeks I'll lose more than my target, others I'll be right on, others I'll gain. It's all good. The important thing is to track everything so that there is a predictability in the relationship between exercising, eating, and weight loss. That way, if after a reasonable amount of time I'm not hitting my target weight loss, I can re-evaluate if my plan is successful. I'm looking at a nearly 8% decrease in my overall body weight and a 10% increase in my FTP over the winter. I will also be building some muscle mass over the winter so my body composition will shift a bit. I still want to achieve a body weight of 175 lbs. That will of course affect the trajectory of my weight loss. Building muscle means adding some weight. This is an important consideration for diet. I don't want to go down the road of intermittent fasting or any nonsense like that. That will impair my athletic performance as well as my muscle mass. It's not only about weight. I think that 190 lbs is a bit heavy, muscle or fat, for most sports. 175 lbs of active, strong muscle with minimal body fat is a really positive state for athletic performance in any of the sports I want to succeed in as well as for my vanity. (I'm going to buy a suit when I'm stable at that weight.) One day at a time. One brick at a time. The important thing is to commit to a course of action for a desired outcome and then to evaluate the outcome in terms of my expectations. Then re-calibrate and commit to the next course of action. In the past, I haven't always been realistic about I've been hoping to achieve out of a particular plan. I'm then disappointed when the plan doesn't deliver on what I thought it would or I keep changing horses mid-stream to try and get where I want to go. That's an impossible path. As the course and destination change, it's impossible to track if I'm on course or not. Then motivation becomes hard, work becomes neurotic, and I'm stuck in and endless churn without any obvious reward. True, I have got in very shape in the past. But I haven't always done it in a healthy way. I also haven't always been able to transform good physical condition into athletic performance. </div><div>An important emotional outlet is the cheat day. It's the day that you don't have to interrogate what you eat. It's a free day to eat whatever naughty food. This will be important because my family life is full of naughty food. I need to cut back on that indulgence without being overly rigid about it. Today is cheat day! I'm getting greasy Thai food for lunch. </div><div>Another important element is the mental training side of things. To visualize the positive outcome, the desired future state and to transform that into action. </div><div>I've started a small fund to save for a sprint canoe. I'll add a bit to it every once in a while but mostly I'll be using a feature of Wealthsimple that rounds off all my purchases and puts the difference into a savings account. It won't add up very quickly but it will get me part of the way to owning my very own sprint canoe. A new canoe will be a few thousand dollars for sure so I'd definitely want to get at least half way there. </div><h2 data-label="915835" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 6, 2019</h2><div>I did another triple workout morning. I will need to get a little more efficient about my morning routines. I've been thinking about it for a while but I really think that getting a coffee maker with a timer will make a big difference. I think I lose at least 20 minutes out my morning making coffee. 20 minutes out of just under 2 hours is quite a bit. </div><div>Back to this morning, I did my core workout and it went so quickly and relatively easily that I went back and did a third set after my planned two. I then went on to pull ups and felt noticeably tired after yesterday's pull up workout. I may alternate pull ups and push ups then to keep from being too tired. I also did push ups this morning. I was running short on time though, so I only did a few sets (60 push ups total. So I think this confirms my theory that it's better to focus on one thing at a time and try to really reach failure rather than doing a little bit of a couple of things. Now how does translate to my core workouts? Well it doesn't really at the moment. I'm doing anatomical adaptation which means it's not intended to be incredibly hard. It's general preparation for the </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
