<div>It's very manageable. Each session will take about 20-30 minutes. I also have the apps I've been using which I'm not sure work all that well for me. I seem to level off at some point for each and not progress beyond that. I've never reached the promised 10 pull ups or 100 push ups or whatever. I had very good success with a simple formula in the past: a regular amount of work that can be repeated with regular rest intervals. It's about finding the sweet spot that you can keep going. That was the formula I used to reach 2000 push ups in a day. I have four exercises that I've sort of tentatively been doing: push ups, pull ups, ab roll outs, and dead lifts. I could do ten sets of each with a minute's rest in between, then gradually find my limit. Then it's about gradually getting stronger and adding more repetitions within that constrained framework. Those four exercises alone would make for more than 40 minutes of activity.&nbsp;</div><div>One thing I haven't been doing enough of is cycling. I don't know if I'll be able to make my weight loss goals without investing more time and energy on the bike. It's really hard to find the time and energy to do everything. My evenings should be for stretching, rollers, and recovery. Definitely drinking a bit less and sleeping a bit more will help. With the strength and core sessions, it's really important to keep track of what I've been doing and what my progress is. It's easy to get discouraged or just bored otherwise. The other piece to work on is balance. I have the core/balance ball program that I used to do. That might work well. I could also get a bosu ball and work on some exercises with that. The problem is scheduling and staying motivated. A good way to stay motivated is to focus on one thing for a set amount of time, then move on to the next thing. That's part of what's at the heart of periodization. </div><div>To achieve my weight loss goal of half a pound a week, I'll need to burn approximately 1750 calories a week (or about 6-7 pizza slices in Zwift). The last hour-long ride I did burned 443 calories, so that's about 4 hours a week on the bike to burn half a pound. If I put my availability as 30 minutes everyday and 1 hour twice a week, will that be enough? Of course the other training I do will also burn calories, raise my metabolism, and increase my muscle mass giving me a better body composition. Also, if I'm a bit more careful with what I eat that will help a lot. I eat a&nbsp;<u>lot</u>&nbsp; of naughty, rich food. </div><h2 data-label="825936" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 5, 2019</h2><div>I did a three-part workout this morning. Core, pull ups, then a recovery bike. I was happy to get through my core workout again without any trouble. I don't have any pain or fatigue from these workouts and that's a good thing. Plenty of time for pain soon! I'm taking a slightly different approach to my strength training. I'm going to delete the apps I have on my phone. They don't work for me. Instead, I'll return to my tested formula of regular intervals of work and rest repeated until positive failure. This will reduce the number of exercises I'll be able to do, but it will get a lot more out of those exercises. For example, this morning I did a total of 40 pull ups. I've never done that many in a single workout. I've never progressed beyond doing 15-16 using the app. That's a big improvement in terms of training volume and I'm a big believer in the importance of volume (with some qualifications of course). </div><div>Between the three workouts I did this morning I burned 369 calories, which is on track for 1750 calories a week for a goal weight loss of half a pound a week. Uncomfortably, since starting this weight loss plan I've gained weight! I was lighter after holidays of eating junk food all day. That's pretty typical though. It's never a straight line down. Your weight goes up then down then up again. What we're looking for is an overall trend downward over time. That will probably mean that some weeks I'll lose more than </div><h2 data-label="915835" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
