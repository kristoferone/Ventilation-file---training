<div>This image here isn't reliable as it's been changing all day. It's a cool feature though. </div><div>I tried to do some pull-ups but the pain in my elbow came back pretty quickly. I'm really not great at being patient, am I? What to do? </div><div>I'm still super light on push-ups. I can do much, much more. I should try and be patient and let my strength grow gradually. I should do the same with my pull-ups. Very easy and gradual. I should probably go back to one pull-up at a time. That's aggravating because I was making really good progress. Maybe I'll just be stubborn and plough through.</div><div>One thing I'm consistently not finding the time to do is stretching. My new development in strength and fluency on the bike may very well have something to do with stretching. Not to mention less pain in general. It's really important. I just need to be a bit more efficient in the morning to make time for it. </div><div>Speaking of being efficient, I've figured out the coffee thing pretty well. The night before I set it for just before 5:00 so it's hot when I come down. Then I reset it to just before 7:00 so it's ready and hot for Mara when I'm done my workout. That's probably shaved 15 minutes off my morning routine. That's enough time to stretch.</div><div>I just need to get straight up, get my coffee, and get on with it. I'll try again tomorrow.</div><div>Tomorrow:</div><ul><li>Meditate - 10</li><li>Push-ups - 10</li><li>Core - (6 * 4) 24</li><li>Stretch - 15</li><li>Bike - 30</li></ul><div>That's an hour and thirty give or take. If I'm up at 5:00 or a little before and get right to it, I have enough time to do all of this. As long as I don't spend half an hour on the toilet. My stomach has generally improved despite the little bug I had. </div><div>I wonder if my biceps aren't strong enough. </div><div>OK, technical focus is still key. Don't end-gain. Keep ADM as the focus and make sure that you're developing habits of accuracy and continuity. </div><h2 data-label="483078" class="ltx_title_subsection">January 31, 2020</h2><div>Great ski last night! Good core workout this morning. And a fantastic bike workout! </div><div><sub>I didn't stretch again though</sub></div><div>I ran out of time. Again I spent longer in the bathroom than I needed to. I should just start my workout then go to the bathroom once it becomes urgent. Sure, it's uncomfortable to start my workout before going to the bathroom. The time's important though. </div><div>Here's a crazy idea: stretch first. I'll do that tomorrow. </div><div>I swapped the core roller for pull-ups this morning. It went really well. I'll stick with it until I can figure out what to do about my elbow. I think it's just a matter of letting it rest and heal then gradually ease back in. Luckily it doesn't bother me during skiing or push-ups or the core roller. </div><div>I think I'm going to have to do some slow rehab to get back to pull-ups properly. </div><div>My body composition continues to move in the right direction. Ah! That reminds me, I need to fill out my chart that I forgot to do on Monday. Arg! That table is impossible to update. I should do it differently. Anyway, I've done very well on my plans and I think I</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
