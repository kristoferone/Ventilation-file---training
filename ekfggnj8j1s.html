<div>This image here isn't reliable as it's been changing all day. It's a cool feature though. </div><div>I tried to do some pull-ups but the pain in my elbow came back pretty quickly. I'm really not great at being patient, am I? What to do? </div><div>I'm still super light on push-ups. I can do much, much more. I should try and be patient and let my strength grow gradually. I should do the same with my pull-ups. Very easy and gradual. I should probably go back to one pull-up at a time. That's aggravating because I was making really good progress. Maybe I'll just be stubborn and plough through.</div><div>One thing I'm consistently not finding the time to do is stretching. My new development in strength and fluency on the bike may very well have something to do with stretching. Not to mention less pain in general. It's really important. I just need to be a bit more efficient in the morning. </div><div>Speaking of being efficient, I've figured out the coffee thing pretty well. The night before I set it for just before 5:00 so it's hot when I come down. Then I reset it to just before 7:00 so it's ready and hot for Mara when I'm done my workout. That's probably shaved 15 minutes off my morning routine. That's enough time to stretch.</div><div>I just need to get straight up, get my coffee, and get on with it. I'll try again tomorrow.</div><div>Tomorrow:</div><ul><li>Meditate - 10</li><li>Push-ups - 10</li><li>Core - </li><li>Stretch</li><li>Bike</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
