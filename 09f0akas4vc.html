<h2 data-label="756369" class="ltx_title_subsection">September 9, 2019</h2><div>Overall, I had a good weekend of training. Bad night with Mara last night though and I didn't train this morning and also didn't get enough sleep. I hope she finally gets some help for her anxiety. It's a bit much. I hope tonight isn't bad. I think a lot will depend of Freddie. If I can keep him nice and calm without any coughing, that will help Mara feel a lot calmer. </div><div>Anyway, back to my training.</div><div>I have two parallel plans for core. One is a muscular endurance based program influenced by Tudor Bompa. This is essentially a progression from simple circuit training to higher and higher volumes of training. </div><div>I've organized my training into 3 blocks that will take me through to May 5th. That date is completely arbitrary, it's just close to the beginning of canoeing season. My cycling sprint plan as well as my core plan and possibly also my strength training at the RCC will all end at that time. My goals are simply to complete my intended training programs that I've set out for this time. Also, I want to achieve a stable weight of 175 lbs which will involve weight loss of about half a pound a week for the length of this period. With my first week down, I haven't been able to stay on course for that rate of weight loss, though I have done the work necessary on the bike and on the mat. </div><div>Alright, so let's lay it out: my bike plan is being managed by SPOKD. I'm not sure of the length of each phase of the plan but there is a foundation, build, and taper phases. I'm currently in foundation. </div><div>My ball routine as originally set out for ten weeks. I'm going to extend that to twelve and I hope for it to lead all the way to the beginning of my indoor training at the club</div><div></div>
