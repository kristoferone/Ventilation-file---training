<div>OK, I've subsrcibed to Dynamic Cyclist. I'll see if it works well or at all. I think the stretches will help with my canoeing. My thinking is that I'm stiff, in large part, because of my cycling, so improving that stiffness should help improve everything. I'll try. First, if I like the routines and want to keep doing them; second, if they have any long-term effect. We'll see. </div><div>I still need to fix my stability ball. Maybe duct tape for now if I can't find my patch kit? I'll try to figure something out tonight. I still really want to work on my balance and stability. I'm a little excited to start my new stretching</div><div></div><div></div>
