<div>OK, I've subscribed to Dynamic Cyclist. I'll see if it works well or at all. I think the stretches will help with my canoeing. My thinking is that I'm stiff, in large part, because of my cycling, so improving that stiffness should help improve everything. I'll try. First, if I like the routines and want to keep doing them; second, if they have any long-term effect. We'll see.&nbsp;</div><div>I still need to fix my stability ball. Maybe duct tape for now if I can't find my patch kit? I'll try to figure something out tonight. I still really want to work on my balance and stability. I'm a little excited to start my new stretching routine. The trick will be to balance everything. </div><h2 data-label="284519" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 29, 2019</h2><div>This morning I did core. I also did meditation as usual and stretching from Dynamic Cyclist. So far I'm pretty impressed. I don't like ambiguity when I'm starting something new and it does a really good job of giving very precise instructions. So my intention is to begin my workout sessions with meditation and end with stretching. All in that's half an hour so I'll need to be more organized with my time. I stall so easily in the morning. Let's have a close look. If I'm out of bed at 5:15 and I need to start making coffee at say 7:45. That's a total of 90 and only 90 minutes of possible training time. That means there's no time to waste. That's really tight on days I'm trying to do meditation, strength, bike, and stretching. Really tight. I may need to get up a little earlier. </div><div>I felt pretty strong in my core work this morning. I had a really slow start though. I lost quite a bit of time there. I still think a coffee maker would be a big help. I think it would help save nearly 20 minutes total. Here's an idea for my lower core. Instead of doing a separate routine, I can add a compound set into my usual core routine. So 6 exercises in total: crunches, side crunches x 2, back extensions, super-people, and maybe three lower core exercises doing sets of 20 or 30. I think I'll try that. If it makes the whole routine too difficult, I'll just keep it as separate. </div><h2 data-label="105264" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 2, 2019</h2><div>I had a very strong bike workout this morning. I had been avoiding doing this workout. It was actually not too bad. So I've got a lot on the go. How will I keep things balanced at the same time as making sure I do enough of everything. </div><ul><li>Monday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Bike (SPOKD) 30-47 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li><li>C1 erg 60-90 min</li></ul><div>Total: 2-3 hrs</div></blockquote><ul><li>Tuesday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Endurance core 44 min</li><li>Stability 9 min</li><li>Lower core  5 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul><div>Total: 90 min</div></blockquote><ul><li>Wednesday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Strength (DC) 30 min</li><li>Strength 25 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul><div>Total: 90 min</div></blockquote><ul><li>Thursday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Endurance core 44 min</li><li>Stability 9 min</li><li>Lower core  5 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul><div>Total: 90 min</div></blockquote><ul><li>Friday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Bike (SPOKD) 30 min</li><li>Strength (DC) 30 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Saturday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Bike (SPOKD) 30 min</li><li>Strength 25 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Sunday off, or:</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li></ul></blockquote><div>Phew! That's a lot! It's manageable though. I've definitely done more training in the past. I was younger then and had less going on in my life as a whole. Managing stress and anxiety are a big part of staying on course. Managing relationships as well. Also getting (just) enough sleep. </div><div>Tomorrow is a core day. It's the next step up the ladder through medium to long endurance. </div><h2 data-label="672350" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 3, 2019</h2><div>Great workout on the erg last night. I got through it really well. My form and technique are really improving a lot and my conditioning is obviously working because I can make it through all the intervals strongly. I'm really looking forward to seeing the alternate coach next week. :) :) My goals are to keep going with the good work I've been doing and to try and have a good repeatable form. Kind of like a machine just ticking away. Once I have a basic solid movement, I can work towards improving that form and building intensity. I'm really happy with my progress so far. I'm just about a month into training and there's a substantial improvement in that time. Canoeing is hard but it absolutely rewards hard work. Every minute of hard work pays off. In part that's what's so rewarding and satisfying about it. </div><div>I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. My fitness has come a long way in the last year. </div><div>So what are the points for me to check through as I do erg work?</div><div>First the reach, then the rotation of my hips, then releasing tension in my hips and shoulders, then stability in my left leg. I'll try a chain: leg, hips, reach, rotate shoulders, stick, hips, release and recover</div><div>Always keep your head forward following your eyes. Keep the finish line in sight. </div><div>And to this morning. Very good, strong core workout. I did everything I had planned. It was not too hard at all. For sure I was happy to be done by the end, but I never wanted to quit. I'm still struggling slightly with my focus. It's coming though. </div><div>Tomorrow is strength. It's definitely a hard workout and a long one too. I think I'm going to make a couple of changes to my strength routine. I'm going to use this order: </div><ol><li>Dead-lift</li><li>One-arm row</li><li>Roll-outs</li><li>Push-ups</li></ol><div>So I'm still going to do timed circuits but instead of repeating continuously I'm going to do 6 dead-lifts, 10 each side rows, 10 roll-outs, then fill up the rest of the time with push-ups. I'm going to keep that order throughout. 5 times 4 minutes. </div><div>After that I've got the Dynamic Cyclist strength routine. I think it's good because it hits all kinds of little muscles and stabilizers and balancers and all that. </div><div>It's actually not a very complicated workout. Not as bad as the core one at all. </div><div>The other thing I'm really interested in happening is the cross-over point with my body composition. I made a graph that puts fat and muscle on a common scale so </div><h2 data-label="482306" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 4, 2019</h2><div>Strength day today! Hard but good. It's a bit of everything. I'm successfully pushing my muscular endurance and overall fitness and conditioning. </div><div>I had a slight twinge in my left hip while I was doing dead-lifts. I'll have to keep an eye on that. </div><div>The Dynamic Cyclist workout was really good. It's all the kinds of things I usually skip but are actually pretty beneficial. </div><div>I feel like I've temporarily plateaued. I feel like nothing is happening despite working&nbsp; </div><div></div><div></div>
