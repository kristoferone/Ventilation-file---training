<div>OK, I've subscribed to Dynamic Cyclist. I'll see if it works well or at all. I think the stretches will help with my canoeing. My thinking is that I'm stiff, in large part, because of my cycling, so improving that stiffness should help improve everything. I'll try. First, if I like the routines and want to keep doing them; second, if they have any long-term effect. We'll see.&nbsp;</div><div>I still need to fix my stability ball. Maybe duct tape for now if I can't find my patch kit? I'll try to figure something out tonight. I still really want to work on my balance and stability. I'm a little excited to start my new stretching routine. The trick will be to balance everything. </div><h2 data-label="284519" class="ltx_title_subsection">November 29, 2019</h2><div>This morning I did core. I also did meditation as usual and stretching from Dynamic Cyclist. So far I'm pretty impressed. I don't like ambiguity when I'm starting something new and it does a really good job of giving very precise instructions. So my intention is to begin my workout sessions with meditation and end with stretching. All in that's half an hour so I'll need to be more organized with my time. I stall so easily in the morning. Let's have a close look. If I'm out of bed at 5:15 and I need to start making coffee at say 7:45. That's a total of 90 and only 90 minutes of possible training time. That means there's no time to waste. That's really tight on days I'm trying to do meditation, strength, bike, and stretching. Really tight. I may need to get up a little earlier. </div><div>I felt pretty strong in my core work this morning. I had a really slow start though. I lost quite a bit of time there. I still think a coffee maker would be a big help. I think it would help save nearly 20 minutes total. Here's an idea for my lower core. Instead of doing a separate routine, I can add a compound set into my usual core routine. So 6 exercises in total: crunches, side crunches x 2, back extensions, super-people, and maybe three lower core exercises doing sets of 20 or 30. I think I'll try that. If it makes the whole routine too difficult, I'll just keep it as separate. </div><h2 data-label="105264" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 2, 2019</h2><div>I had a very strong bike workout this morning. I had been avoiding doing this workout. It was actually not too bad. So I've got a lot on the go. How will I keep things balanced at the same time as making sure I do enough of everything. </div><ul><li>Monday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Bike (SPOKD) 30-47 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Tuesday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Endurance core 44 min</li><li>Stability 9 min</li><li>Lower core  5 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Wednesday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>Meditation (HS) 12 min</li><li>Strength (DC) 30 min</li><li>Strength 25 min</li><li>Stretching (DC) 10-20 min</li><li>Pull/chin-ups 10 min</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Thursday</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ul><li>M</li><li>E</li></ul></blockquote><div></div><ul><li>Friday</li><li>Saturday</li><li>Sunday</li></ul><div></div><div></div>
