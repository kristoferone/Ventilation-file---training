<div>I think this looks really good. Plus meditation and stretching every day. That would mean I'm stressing one thing for a few days then letting it rest while I stress something else. Strength is the one that gets the short straw a little bit as it only has one dedicated day. The idea in principle is to do about an hour of active work a day (Monday will be about two hours, Sunday will be about 30 minutes).&nbsp;</div><div>OK, so tomorrow is strength and bike. Strength should be pull-ups I think. </div><div>I've been thinking about my canoe technique for the erg. I've been trying to think it through like a series of snapshots of different parts of the stroke. A bit like I used do for my guitar technique: place, pressure, pluck, release. For canoe, there's a kind of start position, body upright with weight directly over my right knee. The paddle is in a relaxed position diagonally across my body, my left hand is rotated in a 'frisbee throwing position' as I've heard it described. My right hand is a little more than half way down the shaft. From there I move my weight forward so that my left leg forms a right angle between thigh and shin with my knee directly over my left foot. My right hand extends straight out fully and parallel with the ground. My left hand is above my head but bent and relaxed. My left hand then fully extends as my body rotates towards my left leg. My right hip rotates inwards as well. This is the fullest point of extension right at the catch. I then start to pull through beginning by rotating my hip outwards and my right shoulder follows. As my left hand reaches parallel with the ground, I start to recover. The stroke is complete when I return to the starting position. </div><h2 data-label="936880" class="ltx_title_subsection">December 20, 2019</h2><div>Sick. Tired. Not enough sleep. Despite all that, I did a good meditation session, 200 push-ups, and a solid thworkout on the bike. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
