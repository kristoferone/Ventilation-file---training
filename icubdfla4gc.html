<div>I think this looks really good. Plus meditation and stretching every day. That would mean I'm stressing one thing for a few days then letting it rest while I stress something else. Strength is the one that gets the short straw a little bit as it only has one dedicated day. The idea in principle is to do about an hour of active work a day (Monday will be about two hours, Sunday will be about 30 minutes).&nbsp;</div><div>OK, so tomorrow is strength and bike. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
