<h2 data-label="970949" class="ltx_title_subsection">October 15, 2019</h2><div>22.1 % body fat, 40.5 % muscle.</div><div>I need to change my goals slightly. Or, put them in a slightly different frame. Being 175 lbs - or about 83 kgs - is possible but I'm not sure it's what I should do. A better way to evaluate my weight is in my percentage of body fat. At the moment I'm carrying about 44 lbs of fat, which is in the average range but not great for sports. If my goal is to get down to 17 % or about 34 lbs of fat, I need to lose about 10 lbs while maintaining (or even increasing)my muscle mass. So my new goal is not 175 lbs but 17% body fat which will probably be closer to 185 lbs. Definitely, regular walking to work will help with those goals. I can then use my workouts to focus on fitness and not worrying about burning calories. I'll need to rethink my goals slightly, </div>
