<h2 data-label="978267" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 10, 2020</h2><div>Day two of my new block of training is going well. I went to the gym very quickly yesterday afternoon. It felt pretty good. I didn't go hugely hard, just enough to come back to the office a bit pumped up. :) I'll do the same today at 1:00. </div><div>A good erg session last night. I think things are starting to click a bit. This will be my first week of two erg sessions a week. I'm looking forward to it for all kinds of reasons. I think the extra time will really help improve my paddling so that I can hit the ground (water?) running. I'm working very hard on my balance and stability.</div><div>Speaking of which, I did my first long core workout this morning. It went very well. Challenging but not impossible. My longest overall core workout will only be slightly longer than that and maybe have slightly more rest. 10-minute intervals are always going to be rough. That's the point. Suffer now; triumph later. Or endure later anyway. I quite enjoy these workouts.</div><div>I found a little bit of time this morni</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
