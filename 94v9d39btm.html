<h2 data-label="978267" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 10, 2020</h2><div>Day two of my new block of training is going well. I went to the gym very quickly yesterday afternoon. It felt pretty good. I didn't go hugely hard, just enough to come back to the office a bit pumped up. :) I'll do the same today at 1:00. </div><div>A good erg session last night. I think things are starting to click a bit. This will be my first week of two erg sessions a week. I'm looking forward to it for all kinds of reasons. I think the extra time will really help improve my paddling so that I can hit the ground (water?) running. I'm working very hard on my balance and stability.</div><div>Speaking of which, I did my first long core workout this morning. It went very well. Challenging but not impossible. My longest overall core workout will only be slightly longer than that and maybe have slightly more rest. 10-minute intervals are always going to be rough. That's the point. Suffer now; triumph later. Or endure later anyway. I actually quite enjoy these workouts.</div><div>I found a little bit of time this morning to do some meditation. I've decided to take what I've learned from HeadSpace, my Alexander Technique, and the kind of visualization I developed from guitar playing and put them all together into my own practice. I just set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and try to move from general to specific. Tomorrow morning I'll try and go through two specific scenarios: a 20-second sprint on the bike, and the movement of my right hip while paddling. </div><div>I have a short 30-minute bike workout tomorrow morning, so I have a bit of extra time for meditation and for stretching. I should make some sort of plan for stretching after my Dynamic Cyclist subscription runs out. I think I'll just do DC tomorrow, but I'll start to think ahead. </div><div>Tomorrow will be my second erg practice this week. I think it will be with a rude, snarky teenager. Oh well. It's time paddling. </div><h2 data-label="866768" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 11, 2019</h2><div>Tired this morning. And something wasn't working properly with my power output. I'm sort of hoping it was just my tired legs that were low and not an issue with my trainer/Zwift. I was reading almost 100 w lower than what I'm used to. I'm not sure but I did have a bit too much wine last night. I wonder if that has that much of an effect. My visualization went pretty well. I did some stretching as well and was feeling pretty tight. Daily stretching is definitely very important. </div><div>I've also stepped up some of my work recently so I'm probably feeling a bit of fatigue from that as well.
