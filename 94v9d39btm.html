<h2 data-label="978267" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 10, 2020</h2><div>Day two of my new block of training is going well. I went to the gym very quickly yesterday afternoon. It felt pretty good. I didn't go hugely hard, just enough to come back to the office a bit pumped up. :) I'll do the same today at 1:00. </div><div>A good erg session last night. I think things are starting to click a bit. This will be my first week of two erg sessions a week. I'm looking forward to it for all kinds of reasons. I think the extra time will really help improve my paddling so that I can hit the ground (water?) running. I'm working very hard on my balance and stability.</div><div>Speaking of which, I did my first long core workout this morning. It went very well. Challenging but not impossible. My longest overall core workout will only be slightly longer than that and maybe have slightly more rest. 10-minute intervals are always going to be rough. That's the point. Suffer now; triumph later. Or endure later anyway. I actually quite enjoy these workouts.</div><div>I found a little bit of time this morning to do some meditation. I've decided to take what I've learned from HeadSpace, my Alexander Technique, and the kind of visualization I developed from guitar playing and put them all together into my own practice. I just set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and try to move from general to specific. Tomorrow morning I'll try and go through two specific scenarios: a 20-second sprint on the bike, and the movement of my right hip while paddling. </div><div>I have a short 30-minute bike workout tomorrow morning, so I have a bit of extra time for meditation and for stretching. I should make some sort of plan for stretching after my Dynamic Cyclist subscription runs out. I think I'll just do DC tomorrow, but I'll start to think ahead. </div><div>Tomorrow will be my second erg practice this week. I think it will be with a rude, snarky teenager. Oh well. It's time paddling. </div><h2 data-label="866768" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 11, 2019</h2><div>Tired this morning. And something wasn't working properly with my power output. I'm sort of hoping it was just my tired legs that were low and not an issue with my trainer/Zwift. I was reading almost 100 w lower than what I'm used to. I'm not sure but I did have a bit too much wine last night. I wonder if that has that much of an effect. My visualization went pretty well. I did some stretching as well and was feeling pretty tight. Daily stretching is definitely very important. </div><div>I've also stepped up some of my work recently so I'm probably feeling a bit of fatigue from that as well. Today will be my first second erg session of the week. I look forward to being very, very tired by the end of the week. </div><h2 data-label="802891" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 12, 2019</h2><div>My erg session went great last night! I was really, really getting it. And far from  rude and snarky, Chloe was delightful. I'm going to be pretty skookum by the time I hit the water. I'm really keen to keep the image of perfect technique in mind and keep rehearsing it for next week. </div><div>It's a very light movement. Very easy. Right shoulder and hip pull back to square. That's it. Right arm stays mostly straight. Left engages on the catch. </div><div>Now the problem, actually it's a very good thing, is that with proper technique, I'm a lot more efficient. So I'm going to have to amp up my work. It's not going to be enough to just be on the erg for an hour to burn over 1000 calories, I'm going to have to work for it!</div><div>I did my second endurance stability workout this morning. It was good and hard! Very satisfying to be able to get through these workouts so well. I have one more to do on Saturday and then it's up to 7 minutes! I think the third week of this program is going to be the hardest. After that the workouts are a bit longer, but they've got more rest. I have done some 7-minute intervals (I think), I've never gone as high as 10 though. </div><div>I need to stretch tonight and not drink too much. I've got a nice little one-hour bike workout in the morning. Nothing crazy at all. It will be a chance to push my 10-second power higher, though. I really hope that whatever was wrong with my power output, either mechanical, technological, or physical, will be sorted out and I can push the big power again. </div><div>My body composition continues to move in the right direction. I'm curious to see what my fat level is at my target weight. I'm still nearly 2 kg above my target weight. I think I can reach that by the Spring. I want to really look like a competitive paddler in my paddling clothes and not like a paunchy, middle-aged wannabe. </div><div>The question is which exercise(s) I'm going to keep and which I'm going to drop from my core workout. I'm now doing 6, I have to go to 5 then 4. It's a balance. I think I should rotate through somehow. It's actually very easy, just start each set on a different exercise. By the end of every workout I will have touched on every exercise. If I find that I can't make the transition from one duration to the next with a given exercise then I can reevaluate at that point. </div><div>I'm going to go back to my office gym for the third time this week. When it's empty, it's quite pleasant but if there's anyone there, it feels pretty small. I don't have any particular goals exept to pump up my muscles a bit and reduce the risk of injury. The tendon in my arm has actually improved quite a bit this week. Between a bit of strengthening and not doing any pull-ups, I think I'm on the mend. A bit of stretching and I'll be back to normal in time for the start of paddling season.&nbsp;</div><div>I've got a small twinge in the right side of my back, in the usual spot. I'll have to be careful not to aggravate it too much. </div><div>For my bike tomorrow, I'm going to try and mostly stay within the right zones - if everything's working properly that is - and go very hard for the zone 5 intervals. I have to go over 875 w for neuromuscular development. I have three intervals to do and I'll try and hit that for each of them. I'll do my 6th gear and eighth slope level. </div><div>Just came back from the gym. It was fine. Not super challenging 30 minutes. I did a bit of all kinds of things: military press, bench press, seated row, bent-over row, lat pull downs, curls, shoulder shrugs. It felt fine. </div><div>I really need to try and stretch tonight. Also drink wine, watch movies, relax. </div><div>I'll try and make a little extra time in the morning to do some extra meditation. </div><h2 data-label="859417" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 13, 2020</h2><div>Very tired this morning. No oomph. I did my workout. Just. Well my bike workouts are done for the week. Despite being tired, I got through it alright. I have one more workout this week and I can call the first week of this block done. This is a very challenging block of training. I can imagine how far this will push my fitness and condition. What I really like about it is that it's quite focused. I'm not trying to do bike, core, strength, meditation, stretching, etc. all in a morning. Now, all I have to focus on is bike or core in the morning. I also like that I'm alternating instead of doing several days in a row of one thing.&nbsp;</div><div>I want to keep going on meditation and visualization. I think I'm on the point of really getting it with my paddling. I'm looking forward to Monday night and really going for it. A long set is going to be a good test of my technique and form.</div><h2 data-label="913566" class="ltx_title_subsection"> March 15, 2020</h2><div>One week down on my training. I had a pretty tired and stressed week. It’s going to be a challenge to keep on track over&nbsp;keep on track over the next few weeks. I really, really hope they keep the canoe club open.</div><h2 data-label="365031" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 16, 2020</h2><h2 data-label="940887" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 23, 2020</h2><div>Things are going to be very different for a long time.&nbsp;a long time. I think things will never really be the same ever again. Some things will be better, others worse. This will be a hard time and also an opportunity.&nbsp;</div><div>I need to both make plans and goals but also be flexible to the day-to day changes. Most importantly, I have to stay with it. To stay with my long-term goals. Things will get back to normal, a new normal, eventually.&nbsp;</div><div>I hope that I can get my bike back and fixed. That will make me very happy. I also hope that canoeing, in some form, will be possible this summer. I’ll prepare for it as if it is, but be prepared in case it isn’t.</div><h2 data-label="188624" class="ltx_title_subsection">April 3, 2020</h2><div>This covid-19 life has its ups and downs. It’s very isolating from a sporting point of view. I really miss going to the canoe club and going skiing in the evening. I really miss it. On the whole everything has still been moving in the right direction. I’ve slipped slightly off of my track with my body composition. Not seriously though. I do need to be more mindful about the little in-between snacks. I’m indulging a bit too much.&nbsp;</div><div>Great news is that my FTP is now 297! That’s nearly 300 watts. 300 w was an ambitious goal not very long ago. Before that it didn’t even seem possible. Now I have to keep up with it in my training and that’s going to be challenging. I’m going to be pretty damn strong when my Fall gravel races roll around.&nbsp;</div><div>The last two weeks, I’ve been really struggling with my morning workouts. It’s a combination of all kinds of things: stress, anxiety, not enough sleep, too much booze. I do think that the workouts I was trying to do were putting me off a bit as well. So I’ve changed my tack a bit. I’m going to set a better morning routine that gets all the main points of my athletic performance. It’s not just doing one kind of hard workout. </div><div>Leaving aside the bike for now, there are some main blocks of my fitness. &nbsp;Mental fitness, flexibility and mobility, injury prevention, strength, core strength, muscular endurance, stability, balance, etc.. Without making my workouts crazy, I do need to hit on most of these things regularly. The long endurance core, balance, and stability work I’ve been doing is great. I’ve taken a slight step back and am doing the plan from Bompa’s book. Today I did four minutes for each of the six exercises. In the sixth week I’ll be doing all six for ten minutes each with now rest for a total circuit time of one hour. After those six weeks I can re-evaluate and maybe go back to the program I’m doing n&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
