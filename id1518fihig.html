<div>I had a super hard erg workout last night. Really very hard. I got through it alright though. I think when the skiing season starts to slow down I may try and add in some extra erg workouts to get ready for the season. That's a really good idea. </div><div>I did a pretty good and strong bike workout this morning. It was 30 second intervals in zone 5, so basically as hard as I can go. I hit 664 watts. It's not great, but not bad either. I did move my 30-second power from 432 to 483. That's a good improvement. Remember that the priority tomorrow is to do lots of work above 300 watts. I'll try and keep my zone 2 work relatively low, but all zone 3 will actually be zone 4. </div><div>I also did roll-outs, which went very well, and push-ups which were fine except I kept getting distracted and only did 200 push-ups when I meant to do 300.</div><div>There's always tomorrow. </div><div>Before tomorrow though, there's tonight! I'm going to ski tonight.
