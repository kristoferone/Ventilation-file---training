<div>I had a super hard erg workout last night. Really very hard. I got through it alright though. I think when the skiing season starts to slow down I may try and add in some extra erg workouts to get ready for the season. That's a really good idea. </div><div>I did a pretty good and strong bike workout this morning. It was 30 second intervals in zone 5, so basically as hard as I can go. I hit 664 watts. It's not great, but not bad either. I did move my 30-second power from 432 to 483. That's a good improvement. Remember that the priority tomorrow is to do lots of work above 300 watts. I'll try and keep my zone 2 work relatively low, but all zone 3 will actually be zone 4. </div><div>I also did roll-outs, which went very well, and push-ups which were fine except I kept getting distracted and only did 200 push-ups when I meant to do 300.</div><div>There's always tomorrow. </div><div>Before tomorrow though, there's tonight! I'm going to ski tonight. To stay on track for completing the Salomon Nordik Challenge, I just need to do about 5 km or so. I'd like to do a bit more. It all depends on the conditions and how tired I feel. I still have another workout to do in the morning and I'd like to do more than just bike. I'd like to do some roll-outs and pull-ups.</div><h2 data-label="762844" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 21, 2020</h2><div>Very cold ski last night! I had sore toes after. I'm really happy I went though. I need to wax my skis again though. I kept sticking and losing my balance and my speed. I go back and forth all the time about what I should focus on. Definitely the best exercise is double-poling. It's fun too! And I think maybe good preparation for skate-skiing. </div><div>I'm more than half-way through the Salomon Nordik Challenge. I started on February 4th, 17 days ago and I have 24 days left to complete the rest </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
