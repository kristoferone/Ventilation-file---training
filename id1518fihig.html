<div>I had a super hard erg workout last night. Really very hard. I got through it alright though. I think when the skiing season starts to slow down I may try and add in some extra erg workouts to get ready for the season. That's a really good idea. </div><div>I did a pretty good and strong bike workout this morning. It was 30 second intervals in zone 5, so basically as hard as I can go. I hit 664 watts. It's not great, but not bad either. I did move my 30-second power from 432 to 483. That's a good improvement. Remember that the priority tomorrow is to do lots of work above 300 watts. I'll try and keep my zone 2 work relatively low, but all zone 3 will actually be zone 4. </div><div>I also did roll-outs, which went very well, and push-ups which were fine except I kept getting distracted and only did 200 push-ups when I meant to do 300.</div><div>There's always tomorrow. </div><div>Before tomorrow though, there's tonight! I'm going to ski tonight. To stay on track for completing the Salomon Nordik Challenge, I just need to do about 5 km or so. I'd like to do a bit more. It all depends on the conditions and how tired I feel. I still have another workout to do in the morning and I'd like to do more than just bike. I'd like to do some roll-outs and pull-ups.</div><h2 data-label="762844" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 21, 2020</h2><div>Very cold ski last night! I had sore toes after. I'm really happy I went though. I need to wax my skis again though. I kept sticking and losing my balance and my speed. I go back and forth all the time about what I should focus on. Definitely the best exercise is double-poling. It's fun too! And I think maybe good preparation for skate-skiing. I did just 5 km on the nose. That adds up to just 16 and a half km this week, which keeps me on track.</div><div>I'm more than half-way through the Salomon Nordik Challenge. I started on February 4th, 17 days ago and I have 24 days left to complete the rest of the challenge. So I think I'm in good shape to get it done. I'm going to buy myself a shirt from salomon.com when I'm done. A 15% discount in not really huge but I want to celebrate the accomplishment of having done it. I've never in my life done as much skiing as I have this winter. I'm really enjoying it and I look forward to much, much more skiing in the future and even doing some races.&nbsp; </div><div>Once skiing starts to wrap up, I'll see if I can hop into an extra erg session on Wednesdays. I think I figured out a couple of things on Wednesday. I'll try them out on Monday with Conrad and see what he says. I hope to have a real canoer as a coach this summer. </div><div>I was pretty tired this morning on the bike. I still did a good workout, actually right on what it was supposed to be even though I cut back on the time because I was running late. It was really for the best because I'm feeling quite tired. I've had a very hard series of workouts over the past couple of days. Good workouts, but hard. If I go home early today, I'll do some strength training as well. Then I just have one last bike workout tomorrow morning. It's going to be a good, hard one. Not overwhelming but definitely with a bit of bite to it. </div><h2 data-label="314096" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 24, 2020</h2><div>I got out for a little ski this morning. Not very long, just half an hour give-or-take. It's another 5 km towards the Salomon Nordik Challenge. I'm actually getting a bit nervous that I'm going to run out of winter before I finish it. I think I realistically only have about two weeks left to do it. That means I'll have to go up to about 20 km a week to be able to finish. That's definitely possible. It will just take a little bit of work.&nbsp;</div><div>I've got my erg workout tonight. I'm going to ease of on the resistance a bit to try and move a bit faster. The most important thing is to really get that right hip forward. It might feel a bit awkward at first, but that's the key. I'm going to try and work really hard tonight. I'm not sure what the workout will be, but definitely really push the last 30 seconds of every set. Even on a long one, go full gas for the last 30 seconds. The rest of the time, really focus all of your attention on your right hip. Also make sure not to dig too deeply into the water. Stay on the surface. Try to move more quickly. Also move more. Larger, faster movements. </div><div>Tomorrow morning will be a short bike workout. I'd also like to do a lot of strength. At least 300 push-ups plus roll-outs and pull-ups. </div><div>I still want to work meditation. I'm not entirely sure how at the moment. I think I'll stick with HeadSpace for now, though I'm not entirely convinced it's the best way. It's a good way. And I already have some pretty good habits around it. So I'll stick with it.</div><div>I've been good about doing lots of stretching recently. I think it really helps a lot. I think I need to do more strengthening as well. I think I'm lacking some strength. Actually, I know I'm lacking some strength. I wonder if my elbow problem would clear up if I build up some strength in other areas, such as my back.</div><div>I have to remember that I've achieved most of my goals for this block of training. I've well exceeded some. And I'm still two weeks ahead of schedule. Everything now is icing on the cake. </div><div>Of course things aren't perfect. I'm not as strong or as fit as I'd like to be. That's obvious because you set goals from a long way out and you don't know until you reach them if that was actually your goal or not. The important thing to remember is that I'm setting goals and achieving them.</div><div>These two weeks will almost certainly take me to the end of skiing season. My best skiing season ever. I really hope to complete the challenge. I'm going to buy myself a t-shirt when I do to celebrate and to remind myself of what I'm capable of. </div><div>In two weeks, I'm going to start a new plan and I need to think about what that might look like. I wonder if I should start lifting weights at work. I did that last fall and it worked pretty well for a bit. </div><div>Another question is if I should buy some skate skis now while they're on sale. I think that would be a great idea. I'll check out the ski sale at Mooney's and a few other places and see what I can afford, which is of course nothing, but you know...</div><h2 data-label="267604" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 25, 2020</h2><div>Really excellent erg workout last night! I think some things are clicking that I was struggling with before. The motion that I wasn't getting is that it's a sitting up motion. It's really not what you'd think of as a paddling motion at all. The thing I still need to work on is getting that right hip forward and really extending my reach forward. Also, I need to work on keeping my arms a bit straighter. When I get the motion right, it's a lot easier. When I'm doing it wrong my motions are slow, I'm collapsing onto the paddle, and&nbsp;I feel like I'm muscling through the whole stroke. </div><div>I did about 200 push-ups this morning which is fine. I also did a pretty solid roll-out workout which felt really good and hard. I did some meditation as well.</div><div>The big part of the morning was my bike workout. It was 10 zone-5 intervals. That has a bit of sting, but I actually really like that kind of workout. Though, it's made me doubt the accuracy of spokd benchmarks. I definitely went longer and harder on the fifth and last intervals and I think I should have seen some movement on my 10-second benchmark. It could be that it takes a while to propagate through the system, or maybe they're having some bugs with it. </div><div>I'm hoping to get out for a ski tonight but I'm not sure if the weather will cooperate. I just checked and I think it's going to be OK! I'd better aim for at least 8 km. How I ski will depend a lot on the quality of the conditions. I may just double-pole the whole time like I did yesterday morning, or I may do more with the kick. </div><div>I think I may start weightlifting next week. I'll try and see how it goes. I won't lift on Monday. I'll save my energy for the erg in the evening. I will try and do Tuesday through Thursday. I really hope to still be skiing next week as well but I think at this point, every ski may be the last. I really hope to complete the challenge. I'll probably hit 60 km tonight. That's  massive. That means I can probably get within shouting range of 70km this week. Maybe even a bit more. I have to be careful and gentle about skiing this weekend. If I'm good about it, I'll probably get a chance. If not, it will make both Mara and me feel resentful. </div><div>OK, today is Tuesday, tomorrow is only Wednesday. Already this week, I've done an erg workout, a ski, a bike, and a small strength and core workout. By the end of today, I'll have added another ski to that list. </div><div>Alright, briefly for tomorrow, I've moved my Friday bike workout to tomorrow. That's to free me up to do a ski Friday morning. I can't ski Thursday evening and I think Thursday morning might be not great conditions. Tomorrow night? Who knows? I think a ski tonight and a ski Friday will be a really good chunk towards my goal. </div><div>I also want to do a bit of strength also. Mostly core roll-outs and pull-ups. I need to stay focused to make sure I don't run short on time for an hour-long workout. (I'd also like to have a bit of a wank tomorrow morning). So I'll just do roll-outs and bike. I'm going to try and do a double workout of roll-outs. Then bike. As always, I'll do pull-ups while making lunches and eating breakfast. </div><div>It would be good to stretch as well. Have to get up early! Try stretching before going to the bathroom. Make sure to set up coffee tonight.</div><div>See you tomorrow!</div><h2 data-label="605388" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 26, 2020</h2><div>10 km ski last night! All double-poling. That puts me at 63 of 90 km total or 70%. I'll try and get another 5 or maybe more km on Friday morning. That would leave me with 20 km to do next week. I'm not sure I'll be able to do a whole lot this weekend. I'm going to really try and wrap this challenge up by the end of next week. By Friday morning I will have done more than 20 km this week so I can certainly do that again next. Especially if I get a little bit this weekend. </div><div>I had a solid bike workout this morning. I was feeling tired and doubted myself for a moment but I did it anyway. I'm happy I did because I have a shorter workout. I'm going to try and raise two benchmarks: 10 seconds and 5 minutes. I need to be strategic about how I do the 10 seconds. If I try to go too high I may not sustain a long enough power to raise my benchmark. I'm going to aim to get to 600 w then hold that for 10 seconds. I have five chances to do it but I think probably the first or second are my best chances. For the 5 minute piece, I'm going to&nbsp; try and get to 330 w. That would put me at about as strong as I ever was in cycling (though I'm a wee bit heavier now). So I'll need about 6 minutes total for the piece. I'll need to get to 330 within the first 30 seconds, hold it, then go as hard as I can for the last 30. 330 w also apparently puts me at about competitive for a 4 km pursuit. That's an interesting idea. That would be a cool way to train. I love the idea of being a track cyclist. Not a pure sprinter, but an endurance track cyclist: pursuit, kilo, etc..&nbsp;</div><div>I'll do a bit of strength tomorrow morning as well. I'll make sure to have enough time for my bike and also for stretching. I'll also try and do some visualization. I think I'll just set a timer and do my own thing. </div><div>So tomorrow morning will be short but a bit intense. It's possible that I might be too tired to really go for new benchmarks. I'll try though. I'm actually going to try a bit of visualization to help focus me.</div><h2 data-label="559753" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 27, 2020</h2><div>I set my new benchmarks this morning! I was very strong on the 6-minute piece and I think I could go even higher. I exceeded my goal and set my five-minute power to 357. That's more than a 10% improvement since my last measurement. I think I could within a reasonable amount of time push that power up to 400 w. I felt really quite strong. I also pushed my 10 second power to 684 w. My top overall power was 862 w. I think over the next eight-week block of training, I'd like to push my 20-minute power to 300 w, my five-minute power to 400 w, and my top power to over 1000 w. I think that's all possible. </div><div>Next week is the eighth and last week of this training plan. It's also a recovery week. It's a perfect time then to regroup and think about the next block of training. Off the top of my head I think the focus will switch to sprint on the bike, extra strength workouts during the week, renewed focus on core in the morning, and moving to two erg sessions a week as the skiing winds down for the season. I think my meditation work will shift to more specific actions with my training such as hitting a specific benchmark for an interval or sustained effort over a slightly longer interval. I think I can mentally rehearse specific strategies to get the most out of my bike training. I think over the next eight-week block of training, I'd like to push my 20-minute power to 300 w, my five-minute power to 400 w, and my top power to over 1000 w. I think that's all possible.  </div><div>I think it's a really good idea to squeeze in some extra training during the workday. I think I'll need to start actually arriving on time though. I should probably do that anyway. I'll need to sort out a couple of things. I'll need an outfit to work out in including shoes, a small towel, soap/shampoo, and a bag to keep it all in. I'll use my old Shopify bag, I'll need to get some soap to use. </div><h2 data-label="253930" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 02, 2020</h2><div>Over 18 km of skiing this weekend (18.32) and a total of 34.82 km last week, which is double the goal I set for myself. That's great! I'm feeling apprehensively upset about how much I'm going to miss skiing after the next couple of weeks. I'm going to hit my goal of 90 km within the ski or two. I'll exceed that goal by the end of next week. </div><div>This is a recovery week and I shouldn't go too hard. My focus is going to change a little bit over the next couple of weeks. Skiing will trail off and I'll build some weight-lifting up. I'm going to devote my mornings to meditation, core, and stretching. </div><div>After this week is over, I'm also going to start a new training program on the bike. I'll have to think a bit about what I want to do. I think I'm going to do a sprint program. </div><div>I'm going to spend some time thinking through my goals in a little more detail but core will again be a big focus for this period. For precision, this phase of training will begin on March 9th and continue until May 4th. This is the period that will take me to the beginning of canoeing season. I will start doing two erg sessions a week, plus sprint cycling program, plus weight training, plus core. </div><div>I'd also like to get down to 80 kilos. Weight loss plus building some muscle will have a big effect on my body composition. My weight loss as a whole might slow down a bit, but my body composition will continue to move. </div><div>I'm going to miss skiing a lot. I'm going to miss the time out on my own. I'm going to miss getting out in the cold, fresh air at night. Weight training in that dinky, little hotel gym in my building is not going to do it. I have to keep that as motivation to get out and do real things: bike, canoe, whatever. Real stuff. Make sure to keep canoe as your goal. I think it's a great idea to also plan a bike race for mid to late summer as well. If it goes well and I want to do more, I still have the fall. Actually I should target the fall as my ultimate goal for racing and aim to do one or two gravel races. I'll try and find out what it would cost to get the cross bike up and running. New cranks probably at the least. Maybe pedals as well. I have to find out if new Crank Brothers pedals will be compatible with my Quattros. </div><h2 data-label="274077" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 3, 2020</h2><div>Good erg workout last night. Not super hard but I think made some improvements. Starting next week I'm going to do two erg workouts a week. This morning was a bit of a waste. I didn't really do anything. I'm not too worried because this is a recovery week. I need to make sure I don't have too many days like today and yesterday. I should start getting ready for weight training at work. I need to get my bag ready and I need some clothes to wear. I think I may need a second pair of shorts. </div><div>I'm going to try and complete the Salomon Nordik Challenge tonight. That's 12 kilometres of skiing. I'm going to be so proud of myself when it's done. And I'm really looking forward to my new shirt! If I can't quite do it, that's OK. I still have a bit of time to make up the difference. </div><div>If I can't get the 12 k done tonight, I should go tomorrow morning and just get 'er done. I'm going to start easing back into some core work. It's still a recovery week and I don't need to push too hard. </div><div>Ski tonight!</div><div>Byaa!</div><h2 data-label="990109" class="ltx_title_subsection">March 4, 2020</h2><div>Miserable rain last night so I went skiing this morning. It was a perfectly fine ski though it felt a bit slow. Actually looking at my average speed, it was a perfectly reasonable speed for me.
