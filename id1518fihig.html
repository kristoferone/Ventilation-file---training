<div>I had a super hard erg workout last night. Really very hard. I got through it alright though. I think when the skiing season starts to slow down I may try and add in some extra erg workouts to get ready for the season. That's a really good idea. </div><div>I did a pretty good and strong bike workout this morning. It was 30 second intervals in zone 5, so basically as hard as I can go. I hit 664 watts. It's not great, but not bad either. I did move my 30-second power from 432 to 483. That's a good improvement. Remember that the priority tomorrow is to do lots of work above 300 watts. I'll try and keep my zone 2 work relatively low, but all zone 3 will actually be zone 4. </div><div>I also did roll-outs, which went very well, and push-ups which were fine except I kept getting distracted and only did 200 push-ups when I meant to do 300.</div><div>There's always tomorrow. </div><div>Before tomorrow though, there's tonight! I'm going to ski tonight. To stay on track for completing the Salomon Nordik Challenge, I just need to do about 5 km or so. I'd like to do a bit more. It all depends on the conditions and how tired I feel. I still have another workout to do in the morning and I'd like to do more than just bike. I'd like to do some roll-outs and pull-ups.</div><h2 data-label="762844" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 21, 2020</h2><div>Very cold ski last night! I had sore toes after. I'm really happy I went though. I need to wax my skis again though. I kept sticking and losing my balance and my speed. I go back and forth all the time about what I should focus on. Definitely the best exercise is double-poling. It's fun too! And I think maybe good preparation for skate-skiing. I did just 5 km on the nose. That adds up to just 16 and a half km this week, which keeps me on track.</div><div>I'm more than half-way through the Salomon Nordik Challenge. I started on February 4th, 17 days ago and I have 24 days left to complete the rest of the challenge. So I think I'm in good shape to get it done. I'm going to buy myself a shirt from salomon.com when I'm done. A 15% discount in not really huge but I want to celebrate the accomplishment of having done it. I've never in my life done as much skiing as I have this winter. I'm really enjoying it and I look forward to much, much more skiing in the future and even doing some races.&nbsp; </div><div>Once skiing starts to wrap up, I'll see if I can hop into an extra erg session on Wednesdays. I think I figured out a couple of things on Wednesday. I'll try them out on Monday with Conrad and see what he says. I hope to have a real canoer as a coach this summer. </div><div>I was pretty tired this morning on the bike. I still did a good workout, actually right on what it was supposed to be even though I cut back on the time because I was running late. It was really for the best because I'm feeling quite tired. I've had a very hard series of workouts over the past couple of days. Good workouts, but hard. If I go home early today, I'll do some strength training as well. Then I just have one last bike workout tomorrow morning. It's going to be a good, hard one. Not overwhelming but definitely with a bit of bite to it. </div><h2 data-label="314096" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 24, 2020</h2><div>I got out for a little ski this morning. Not very long, just half an hour give-or-take. It's another 5 km towards the Salomon Nordik Challenge. I'm actually getting a bit nervous that I'm going to run out of winter before I finish it. I think I realistically only have about two weeks left to do it. That means I'll have to go up to about 20 km a week to be able to finish. That's definitely possible. It will just take a little bit of work.&nbsp;</div><div>I've got my erg workout tonight. I'm going to ease of on the resistance a bit to try and move a bit faster. The most important thing is to really get that right hip forward. It might feel a bit awkward at first, but that's the key. I'm going to try and work really hard tonight. I'm not sure what the workout will be, but definitely really push the last 30 seconds of every set. Even on a long one, go full gas for the last 30 seconds. The rest of the time, really focus all of your attention on your right hip. Also make sure not to dig too deeply into the water. Stay on the surface. Try to move more quickly. Also move more. Larger, faster movements. </div><div>Tomorrow morning will be a short bike workout. I'd also like to do a lot of strength. At least 300 push-ups plus roll-outs and pull-ups. </div><div>I still want to work meditation. I'm not entirely sure how at the moment. I think I'll stick with HeadSpace for now, though I'm not entirely convinced it's the best way. It's a good way. And I already have some pretty good habits around it. So I'll stick with it.</div><div>I've been good about doing lots of stretching recently. I think it really helps a lot. I think I need to do more strengthening as well. I think I'm lacking some strength. Actually, I know I'm lacking some strength. I wonder if my elbow problem would clear up if I build up some strength in other areas, such as my back.</div><div>I have to remember that I've achieved most of my goals for this block of training. I've well exceeded some. And I'm still two weeks ahead of schedule. Everything now is icing on the cake. </div><div>Of course things aren't perfect. I'm not as strong or as fit as I'd like to be. That's obvious because you set goals from a long way out and you don't know until you reach them if that was actually your goal or not. The important thing to remember is that I'm setting goals and achieving them.</div><div>These two weeks will almost certainly take me to the end of skiing season. My best skiing season ever. I really hope to complete the challenge. I'm going to buy myself a t-shirt when I do to celebrate and to remind myself of what I'm capable of. </div><div>In two weeks, I'm going to start a new plan and I need to think about what that might look like. I wonder if I should start lifting weights at work. I did that last fall and it worked pretty well for a bit. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
