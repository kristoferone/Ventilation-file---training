<div>I did another triple workout morning. I will need to get a little more efficient about my morning routines. I've been thinking about it for a while but I really think that getting a coffee maker with a timer will make a big difference. I think I lose at least 20 minutes out my morning making coffee. 20 minutes out of just under 2 hours is quite a bit. </div><div>Back to this morning, I did my core workout and it went so quickly and relatively easily that I went back and did a third set after my planned two. I then went on to pull ups and felt noticeably tired after yesterday's pull up workout. I may alternate pull ups and push ups then to keep from being too tired. I also did push ups this morning. I was running short on time though, so I only did a few sets (60 push ups total. So I think this confirms my theory that it's better to focus on one thing at a time and try to really reach failure rather than doing a little bit of a couple of things. Now how does that translate to my core workouts? Well it doesn't really at the moment. I'm doing anatomical adaptation which means it's not intended to be incredibly hard. It's general preparation for the harder work that will come soon enough. </div><div>OK, so core training is under way. I haven't figured out the entire progression yet and how that will fit in with the rest of my training. I'm going to follow some version of Tudor Bompa's program. I'm going to augment my program with the stability ball program that I got many years ago from the NSCA journal which doesn't seem to exist anymore. The author of the program suggests doing the program 2-3 times a week. The overall work will take about 20 minutes. My current core program takes about 5 minutes a circuit and I do 2-3 circuits. So I'm still looking at only about 30-35 minutes of core a day. And yes, I'll probably do the routine every day. I don't see any reason not to. Well a slight clarification, I may not work core every single day. Or maybe I should. Maybe I should only do strength on certain days. I'm not planning on a lot of recovery. There's always busy days, tired days, sick days. There are enough opportunities for rest. Scheduling it in becomes an exercise in lost opportunities. I know the signals of when I need rest. I'll make sure to pay attention. One surprise this morning is that my power zones for SPOKD have shifted down quite a bit. So my effort today was quite a bit harder than it needed to be. That's fine. I felt perfectly good this morning and happy to push a bit. Honestly I did wonder if I was going a bit hard for what the workout was supposed to be. That makes things a bit easier for the next little bit of training. I'm a little surprised that missed any notice of it happening. I don't think I changed it myself. </div><div>I'm still gaining weight. Well that's an overstatement, this is still the level of daily fluctuations. I have to remember that I'm only looking at going from 187 to 186.5 lbs within a week. Still though, with the gain over the last few days, that progression is probably out of reach. </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div></div>
