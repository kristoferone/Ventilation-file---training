<div>I'm going to try the second step of the plan. I'm not at all sure I'll be able to do it. I'll try though. The nice thing is that's only two circuits. So even if it's horrible, I only have to do it twice. Actually tomorrow I'll just through the circuit once to get the feel for it. I'm really going all in on core training plus pull-ups. I did 300 push-ups this morning which is also really good. I can keep doing that once a week or so. My core routine is pretty good for my whole body. I'm starting to feel pretty strong with my pull-ups as well. </div><div>My lower back on the left side is still a bit tricky.
