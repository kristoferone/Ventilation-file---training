<div>I'm going to try the second step of the plan. I'm not at all sure I'll be able to do it. I'll try though. The nice thing is that's only two circuits. So even if it's horrible, I only have to do it twice. Actually tomorrow I'll just through the circuit once to get the feel for it. I'm really going all in on core training plus pull-ups. I did 300 push-ups this morning which is also really good. I can keep doing that once a week or so. My core routine is pretty good for my whole body. I'm starting to feel pretty strong with my pull-ups as well. </div><div>My lower back on the left side is still a bit tricky. It did a nasty twinge a couple of times and just about went out once. I thought I just had a bit of muscle fatigue this week but I think it's turned into a bit of a back strain. Or maybe it's just the same strain of two weeks ago that hadn't completely recovered. The thing to do like always is stretch, heat, meditation, roller, tens if you need it, rest if you can get it and, in the long run, keep strengthening your core. I'm doing all those things, so I just need to be calm and confident that I will move past this. In the meantime, I think I should avoid too much heavy lifting until the pain and fatigue are gone.&nbsp;</div><div>Because of Erik's birthday, I've got another full week until my next erg session so I have time to recover, time to strengthen. </div><div>I think the routine I have is a really good one of focusing mostly on core, with some bike, and a smaller part of strength. In the future, I'll want to focus most of my fall-spring training on strength. For now though, my core is weak so </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
