<div>Tired and slightly hungover this morning. Alcohol really affects training a lot. I'm glad I've cut back so much on my drinking. I still managed a pretty strong bike workout this morning. I did some strength training as well. As I've suspected recently, I'm not very strong. That's why I'm going to focus on strength for a little bit. I still have time to do more core and stability before the start of paddling season. </div><div>I'm going skiing tonight! I'm going to do a run around the full course then fill up the rest on the tracks to about 7.5 kms. </div><div>I'll then ski again in the morning. That might be a wee bit tough. It's good for me though. I'd also like to do some strength training tomorrow morning. I have to make sure I'm not completely cooked for my erg workout in the evening. I hope it's not awkward. I wonder who the coach is and if they have a free canoe erg or if we'll have to share. </div><h2 data-label="123039" class="ltx_title_subsection">February 19, 2020</h2><div>Really hard ski last night. I was tired and felt stressed about Mara. The tracks were also bad and it was very windy. I called it quits after just 30 minutes and only 5 km. I'll still have time to get enough mileage this week. I was feeling really tired also. I decided to just take it easy this morning and save some energy for the erg tonight. I just meditated and stretched. I still feel pretty tired and stiff. I should be good to rock and roll tonight though.</div><div>So, I'm past the half-way point of this block of training. I've achieved almost all of my goals for my training and body already. The notable exceptions are with strength. I wanted to be able to do 20 pull-ups and 100 push-ups. I think that's still possible. I haven't got there yet though. I could try a test and see where I am at the moment. I would guess about halfway on both. I'm not sure I can get to the full amount within three weeks. </div><div>I'm definitely going to reach my goals for skiing and exceed them. I've exceeded them already. I still have a long way to go but I've taken a big step towards improvement. Next year, I'm going to take a skating course and aim to do the Gatineau Loppet for classic. </div><div>Let's talk about some short-term goals:</div><ul><li>FTP 300 w</li><li>100 push-ups</li><li>20 pull-ups</li></ul><div>How am I going to get there? For FTP, I'm just going to train  over 300 watts as much as I can. Both Friday and Saturday this week I'll have the chance to do some training at 300 watts. </div><div>As for push-ups and pull-ups, I'm going to create a mini periodization plan. </div><div>It's going to go for 3 weeks, the remaining 3 weeks of my plan. First, build some volume, then build some muscle, then build some endurance. The goals are pretty simple: in the first phase there's a balance of work and recovery so that I can keep going and build up some volume. I'm thinking 600 push-ups in a session. In the second phase reduce the rest so that you're hitting failure on every set. In the last, I'll want to do as many push-ups as I can in a set with complete rest in between. Hopefully I'll be able to hit 100 push-ups in a set. </div><div>I think it would be wise to focus only on push-ups for this phase. If I make my goal, I'll move on to pull-ups. If not, I'll try again. I'll keep doing pull-ups and roll-outs but just not with any huge goal. </div><div>I've got an erg workout tonight. I'm not sure what to expect but I'll do my best. Then I've got bike and strength in the morning then ski in the evening. Then bike again the following morning. I'm going to be pretty wiped by the time the weekend rolls around.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
