<div>OK, so core training is under way. I haven't figured out the entire progression yet and how that will fit in with the rest of my training. I'm going to follow some version of Tudor Bompa's program. I'm going to augment my program with the stability ball program that I got many years ago from the NSCA journal which doesn't seem to exist anymore. The author of the program suggests doing the program 2-3 times a week. The overall work will take about 20 minutes. My current core program takes about 5 minutes a circuit and I do 2-3 circuits. So I'm still looking at only about 30-35 minutes of core a day. And yes, I'll probably do the routine every day. I don't see any reason not to. Well a slight clarification, I may not work core every single day. Or maybe I should. Maybe I should only do strength on certain days. I'm not planning on a lot of recovery. There's always busy days, tired days, sick days. There are enough opportunities for rest. Scheduling it in becomes an exercise in lost opportunities. I know the signals of when I need rest. I'll make sure to pay attention. One surprise this morning is that my power zones for SPOKD have shifted down quite a bit. So my effort today was quite a bit harder than it needed to be. That's fine. I felt perfectly good this morning and happy to push a bit. Honestly I did wonder if I was going a bit hard for what the workout was supposed to be. That makes things a bit easier for the next little bit of training. I'm a little surprised that missed any notice of it happening. I don't think I changed it myself. </div>
